VAfter the Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident in the Ukraine most of the oregano crop was radioactive, so it was mixed with sumac or other leafy greens to decrease its detectable radiation levels. It is unknown if any illnesses or deaths were caused. Many foods were hard to obtain in the area, so crops that could pass testing for radioactive material could be sold at premium prices. It is unknown how the adulteration was detected.

VLarge quantities of Russian and Iranian caviar was imported into the U.S. as "immediate export" and replaced with American caviar to be shipped internationally, while the Russian and Iranian goods were sold in the U.S. No illnesses or deaths were reported. At the time imports from Russia and Iran were heavily taxed, but immediate export goods were exempt allowing a higher profit to be earned. In addition the American caviar exported around the world was being sold as the Russian or Iranian higher quality caviar. This was part of a larger scheme where the weight was also under recorded to avoid import taxes. The adulteration was caught during an investigation by Immigration and Customs Enforcement's and Homeland Security.

VCheese imported from Nicaragua by a Florida company was found to be contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus as well as mislabeled as pasteurized. The contamination and mislabeling was caught on import into the United States, and the company was told to destroy or re-export the product. However, the cheese had been sold before the decision about entry had been made by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The incident was prosecuted by the FDA and ICE. The two principal perpetrators were sentenced to prison and probation, respectively.

VTable salt was mixed into industrial grade salt and sold as salt for human consumption in China. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Table salt is sold for a higher price and is a higher quality. The industrial salt was put into counterfeit packaging stating that it was table salt to increase profit margins. The police raided a residential home where they found the substituted salt amounting to 10 tons; it is unknown how police became aware of the adulteration.

VAs a result of Opson IV, a joint operation between Interpol and Europol, 31 tones of adulterated seafood was discovered. A fish processing facility located in Italy was selling previously frozen seafood as fresh. The seafood, which was rotting, was sprayed with a chemical containing citric acid, phosphate and hydrogen peroxide. This allowed the perpetrators to make the aged seafood look like freshly caught and sell it to the customers. The Italian facility was not the only one involved. Another company located in Spain was the supplier of the the spoiled seafood. There, the officials seized 15 more tonnes of the seafood that was ready for shipment to Italy.

There alcohol was being produced from pure alcohol, water, citric acid, chemical dyes and other chemicals to resemble the color and odor of the the branded alcohols such as Jack Daniels, Martini, Remi Martin, and Bacardi. The illegal manufacturing is closed and several suspects are being investigated. Officials suggest that his manufacturing facility has been operating for 2 or 3 years. Recently, there were several deaths and serious illnesses in the region from the illicit alcohol. It is unclear though whether these people were poisoned by the alcohol manufactured in this particular plant.

VAs many as 8 sushi restaurants in San Diego area were found guilty in adulterating their products. Thus, the sushi rolls that were advertised as \u201clobster rolls\u201d contained no lobster in them. Rather, the laboratory DNA testing revealed that cheaper kinds of seafood such as pollack and crawfish were used instead of lobster. All the perpetrators are facing monetary fines as it is illegal to misbrand food products.

VAs a result of the investigation by the DDA in Bari, which was launched following the poor 2014 harvest of olives in Italy, 7,000 tons of olive oil were discovered adulterated. Even though the oil labels indicated "100% Italian" extra virgin olive oil, in reality the oil was transshipped from Middle East countries like Morocco, Tunisia, Turkey, and Syria. The harm due to the illicit turnover of the misrepresented oil was estimated to be in the tens of millions of euros.

VAbout 70% of the samples tested in the olive oil study released by the Olive Center at the University of California, Davis, were found failing various tests which aimed to discover adulteration. Among the reasons why the samples failed extra virgin olive oil standards the researchers indicate adulteration with cheaper refined oil and production of the oil form damaged and overripe olives.

VTesting of milk sold in Mohali, India, was organized by the Punjab Dairy Development Board in October 2015. Thus, out of 83 tested samples of milk 31 sample was found diluted with water. The officials indicate that no other harmful chemicals was detected in the adulterated samples. It should be noted that in similar testing that was conducted in Mohali in June 2015, only 17 percent of the tested samples were found diluted with water. The increased rate of dilution might have taken place due to festive season in India which traditionally goes during the Fall time.

VVirginia Star and International Sea Products imported $15.5 million worth of catfish that was illegally labeled and imported as sole, grouper, flounder, snakehead, channa and conger pike (a type of eel). However, DNA tests revealed that the frozen fish was actually Pangasius hypophthalmus, a fish in the catfish family marketed under approved trade names including swai or striped pangasius. An anti-dumping duty was placed on Pangasius hypophthalmus imports from Vietnam in January 2003 after a petition was filed by domestic catfish farmers, who alleged that this fish was being imported from Vietnam at less than fair market value. Overall, mislabeling fish to deceive buyers and causing economic damage to American catfish farmers constitutes as food fraud.

VTwo people were accused in milk adulteration. The perpetrators mixed urea, milk powder and sunflower oil to prepare batches of paste, which was then diluted with large volumes of water until the mixture had a consistence and appearance of milk. The fake "milk" was then distributed to the market including different sweet shops and roadside tea stalls. A total of 600 liters of adulterated milk, 40 kg of urea, and 18 packets of milk powder were seized from the perpetrators.

VAs a result of a surprise raid to a jogger auction, the officials found that five out of fifteen tested tonnes of jaggery and jaggery powder were adulterated with sodium hydro sulphate. The chemical was added to jaggery to achieve the distinct color and attract consumers. The officials seized 8.5 tonnes of adulterated jaggery and the samples were sent to the Food Testing Laboratory. Besides the intent to achieve special jaggery color, another reason for the adulteration might have been the crash in sugarcane prices and a glut of sugar in the market which led to a steep crash in sugar prices. Due to the fact that jaggery production is pricy and the jaggery prices have not declined, traditional consumers of jaggery in rural areas are switching to sugar.

VIn restaurants and grocery stores around Scotland, less expensive smoked fish such as whiting was sold as more expensive fish like haddock. No illnesses or deaths were reported. The price differences between the fish are very high, creating a high profit margin. The identity of a fish is hard to determine by eye after it has been filleted, and even harder after it has been smoked. DNA testing is the only way to verify the identity. Concerns were raised by food experts within Scotland which initiated an investigation by the Food Standards Agency who then issued a report based on their findings.

VRestaurants in China sold beef advertised as "Kobe" beef that had in fact been raised locally or imported from Australia. Kobe beef comes only from a specific region in Japan and the importation of beef from Japan to China was banned due to concerns around bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Restaurant owners were able to charge high prices for the product as Kobe beef is considered a delicacy. Some restaurants serving "Kobe" beef only served the beef by request and did not place it on their menus, making it difficult for authorities to prove that the restaurants were serving fake "Kobe" beef. The incidents were discovered through media reports which then led to formal inspections.

VA man in Maryland was charged with selling meat at his store in Front Royal that was outdated and not fit for human consumption. There was ambiguity about whether the meat was sold to him at discounted prices by other retailers or retrieved from dumpsters behind said retailers. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Meat was either bought at very cheap prices or taken from dumpsters to be sold at discount prices. In 2012 there were allegations by an unknown source about the quality of meat being sold, which instigated a criminal complaint by a member of Maryland's Office of Meat and Poultry Services.

VThe investigation that was triggered by many public complaints and information from confidential sources, found that out of the 150 samples of alcoholic beverages collected from different bars and restaurants in New Jersey, 30 were fraudulent. Most frequently, cheap liquor was substituted for more expensive brands; in some instances brand bottles were diluted with rubbing alcohol, caramel coloring, or water. It was determined, that buyers of the adulterated alcohol were charged premium prices even though their drinks were made with less expensive alcohol.

VLow quality chocolate was repackaged and sold as Wonka bars in the UK, all containing "golden tickets" and lacking identifying labeling. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Nestle has not made Wonka bars since 2010, and the bars were associated with a promotion to increase sales. The counterfeit bars were made from very low quality chocolate and sold directly to shops by traveling salesmen. BBC'S Fake Britain program tipped off the Suffolk Trading Standers officers to the adulterated chocolate with fake winning tickets.

VPackaged arborio rice, which is a premium kind of risotto rice, was found to be diluted with a cheaper kind of risotto rice called ribe rice. The packages were sold in UK supermarkets. The unaware consumers were charged premium prices for mislabeled packages with diluted arborio rice. It is suspected that the adulteration was triggered by poor risotto rice harvest in 2013; the prices were pushed up from $400 a tonne to $1,000 a tone in 2014.

VMore than 100,000 metric tons of smuggled frozen meat worth up to 3 billion yuan ($483 million) was confiscated by Chinese authorities as a result of a crackdown that took place in 14 different provinces. Officials reported that the perpetrators smuggled the meat from India and Brazil through countries such as Vietnam and Hong Kong to decrease its cost. Moreover, most of the sealed meat products were far older than their true expiration dates and some of the meat was reportedly more than 40 years old. Because the meat was kept under poor sanitary conditions and repeatedly frozen and thawed, it might have been contaminated with pathogenic organisms.

In particular, it was determined that products branded as International Packing Parmesan Cheese, Romano 100% Grated Cheese, and 100% Grated Parmesan Cheese were diluted with cellulose and starches to increase the weight of the cheese base as well as with other non-parmesan cheeses. In fact, products in which parmesan was declared as an ingredient contained no real parmesan. Moreover, the finished product labels failed to declare all the ingredients that were used to prepare the adulterated product.

VAn investigation conducted by the Department of Consumer Affairs in New York City revealed that pre-packaged foods sold at Whole Foods was mislabeled with incorrect weights and customers were systematically overcharged. Though Whole Foods representatives claimed that the products weight may deviate both to favor and disfavor customers and none of the products was mislabeled intentionally, officials state that all 80 different types of pre-packaged products that were taken from Whole foods for testing were labeled incorrectly. Moreover, 89 percent of the packages tested did not meet the federal standard for the maximum amount that an individual package can deviate from the actual weight. The overcharges ranged from $0.80 for a package of pecan panko to $14.84 for a package of coconut shrimp.

VA study of meat products in South Africa determined that out of 139 tested products, 68% had been adulterated with soy, gluten, donkey, goat, water buffalo, pork, and chicken. The adulterated products include minced meats, burger patties, deli meats, sausages and dried meats. Despite local regulations around the mislabeling of meat contents, the regulations were not adequately enforced allowing for the adulteration to take place. The researchers used DNA and ELISA tests to detect undeclared meat and plant products.

VPeanut butter was produced with Salmonella contaminated peanuts and knowingly sold to customers. The company had been previously shipping product before microbiological testing results had been received, and did not notify customers when these tests came back positive for Salmonella. In addition many of these products were shipped with fake certificates of analysis. When a customer reported the detection of Salmonella the company responded that this had never happened before and that they had no evidence of Salmonella in their product or plant. Other products were adulterated with dust and rat excrement, but were shipped anyway. As a result, there were 714 officially recognized cases of Salmonella Typhimurium infections in the U.S. 9 of which were lethal. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recognizes that as many as 20,000 people might have been sickened by the contaminated peanut butter but did not report about their sickness. CDC and state health departments identified peanut butter as the source and an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration was launched. The product was recalled, but it was months before it was fully out of the food supply. The company owners were indicted.

VA slaughterhouse in Australia mislabeled cuts of meat from processed sheep. Lesser quality cuts of meat from older animals, referred to as "hogget" or "mutton" were mislabeled as "lamb" which refers specifically to premium and more expensive cuts of meat from younger animals. The mislabeling was discovered during an audit of the company when problems were detected with carcass classification.

Most of the honey was sold to food processors. However, the jury ultimately ruled in favor of the honey processor.

VA large industrial honey processing firm knowingly purchased and facilitated the transportation of at least 1,578 container loads of Chinese honey that was illegally smuggled into the U.S. The honey was either declared as originating from other countries (such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Thailand, and Vietnam), or was declared as sugar syrups other than honey in order to avoid antidumping duties (estimated up to $180 million). The incident may have been uncovered as part of increased investigations into the evasion of antidumping duties in the honey trade by U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

VSerbian sugar producers bought sugar on the world market and repackaged it as a domestic product to sell to the EU at a markup, since the EU had offered Serbia preferential treatment in order to encourage the development of a domestic sugar-beet industry. The fraud was discovered when EU auditors discovered Serbia had exported at least four times the allowable quantities of sugar to the EU, resulting in an estimated $7 million in profits.

VChains like Publix, Wal-Mart, Winn-Dixie and Target were losing $1 million to $2 million each year because of baby formula thefts. In Florida, several people were accused in baby formula crime and arrested on July 2nd, 2014 as a result of operation "Got Milk". The stolen cans of Similac, Enfamil and other baby formula brands legally sold for $20 to $45 were sold for an average of $6 to local "fences" who then sold them to a regional buyer for shipmen around and outside the US.

VThan Nguyen, also known as Tran Nguyen, was accused in accusing stolen baby formula and reselling it to different markets including New York, California, and Vietnam. Considering that brand-named baby formula is sold for as much as $100 in stores, and only for $10 when sold by the shoplifters. Due to the high profit margin and continuous demand, baby formula is one of the most popular products for theft followed by repackaging and illegal trade. It is believed that Nguyen and her "helpers" ran the illegal business for at least 18 months.

VSeveral products produced by Mexicantown Bakery, which is located in Detroit, MI, were found to be adulterated with artificial colors. In particular, FDA inspectors determined that artificial colors FD&C Yellow No. 5, FD&C Yellow No. 6, FD&C Red No. 3, and FD&C Red No. 40 were used in manufacturing of Concha Blancas, Concha Yellow, and Concha pink bakery products; yet, the presence of the colors was not identified on the production labels. According to FDA, Mexicantown Bakery has a history of similar incidents. Thus, in 2011 and 2012 very similar products were recalled for the same reason - use of artificial colors without implementation of appropriate labels and handling procedures.

VThe Indian buyers who look exclusively for only pure white sago products such as vermicelli became victims of sago adulteration. To achieve pure white color, sago factories used various banned chemicals including bleach liquor, concentrated sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid. These chemicals were stored without permission in a rice godown at Vadakku Udayarpalayam and were seized during a raid by the Food and Safety officials. The owner of the raided godown told officials that the seized chemicals were supposed to go to sago units.

VIn British Columbia, Canada, a meat processor knowingly sold beef and lamb products that were contaminated with E. coli O157:H7. In September 2010, 1,500 kilograms (3,300 pounds) of Halal-labeled meat products were sold to the market prior to receiving lab results. The company subsequently received a positive test result for E. coli, but did not recall the contaminated meat from the market. The incident was discovered after a plant employee informed the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) about the positive test result. It is believed that one of the triggers for this adulteration was an increased demand for halal meat for the celebrations of Ramadan.

VIn Italy, a fraudulent production of ham was discovered. The ham, which was originally produced in Poland, was repackaged and distributed with counterfeit labels of Italian ham brands, even those of the consortium of Parma ham. Likely, the adulteration was motivated by the fact that Italian brands are well known for their quality and therefore sold at a premium price. Even though the fraudulent production is stopped and all the equipment is seized, investigators still have to determine where the mislabeled meat was distributed and sold.

The company was specializing on producing a local Irish wild honey. Yet, the experts believe that adulteration took place. Thus, there are claims that "Irish Honey Sensations" is a honey bought in a super market at a cheaper price, repackaged and relabeled, and then sold to upmarket retail outlets. Profit is considered to be the driving force for this adulteration.

The names of the brands remained undisclosed. The claims were based on the tests of the commercially available coconut water. The testing was conducted in Krueger Food Laboratories. It is suggested that sugars can be added to genuine coconut water to help mask the taste of the naturally occurring minerals in pure coconut water, and, in some cases, replace coconut water sugars themselves.

According to Ukrainian food standards, honey is divided onto categories based on the strictness of quality requirements. Honey "\u041f\u0430\u0441\u0456\u043a\u0430" was claimed to be "grade 1" honey; yet, the analysis showed that this honey did not comply with the food standards. The amount of hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) found in honey "\u041f\u0430\u0441\u0456\u043a\u0430" exceeded the standard requirements almost four-fold.

Though the company claimed that its products were organic and raised in California, anonymous sources report that GGM's mushrooms were imported Japan, Hokuto. Unlike GGM, the producer from Japan was not certified as organic producer at the time sales occurred. Thus, GGM was convicted in putting false statements on its labels and misrepresenting the origin of its mushroom products.

As the result, it was found that 80 percent of the collected samples were adulterated with substandard oil, mawa, water, and sugar. On top of that, officials report that khowa samples tested positive for blotting paper and urea. This has been common during the Diwali festivities. The alarming fact is that many people get at least stomach ache after consuming adulterated products.

VIn China, 45 infant formula manufacturers were accused of selling substandard baby formula, in which essential nutrients were replaced with starches, sugars, and artificial milk flavors. Some of the collected samples contained as little as one-sixth of the required amount of protein and other nutrients needed for a baby's proper development. This led to nutritional starvation in children, numerous hospitalization instances, and 12 deaths. In some provinces the adulterated infant formula was not removed immediately after the adulteration had been disclosed leading to a prolonged response. It was reported that An analysis of one formula found it contained as little as one-sixth of the required amount of protein and other nutrients needed for a baby's proper development.

VLarge-scale butter fraud was discovered in the EU in 1999 that involved organized crime and multiple large European companies. More than 16,000 tonnes of butter was falsely produced using beef tallow, vegetable material, non-food grade oils, and chemical additives. The substance was sold to food companies for incorporation into butter for retail sale, concentrated butter, and other food products. EU butter subsidies were also claimed on the adulterated product. Corruption allowed for easier export and the lack of detection by proper authorities. This butter adulteration scheme was discovered because of other investigations into the organized crime network that was running the operation.

VAn unlicensed corn bun production site produced and sold fraudulent corn buns that did not contain any real corn, but were composed of wheat flour with chemical flavoring and coloring. Over 200,000 adulterated buns were sold during a one month period. Just days before this incident, a Chinese food company was shut down for selling adulterated buns, leading to a probe into the Chinese bun market and the discovery of these adulterated buns.

VA company that marketed their pomegranate juice as "100 percent pure pomegranate juice" with "no added sugar or sweeteners" sold juice with large amounts of high-fructose corn syrup and only small amounts of pure pomegranate juice. Pomegranate juice is a high-value product compared to many other juices and has been advertised as having health benefits, thereby increasing consumer demand. Fraudulent production of a less expensive product can undercut market prices. It is unclear at what point in the supply chain the adulteration occurred. A competing juice manufacturer discovered the adulteration and brought legal action against the perpetrating company, which was ultimately ordered to pay damages in 2008.

VA Chinese food company adulterated corn bun dumplings by adding yellow dye to artificially produce the appearance of corn flour, using undeclared artificial flavors to increase corn flavor, re-labeling the expiration dates on the packages, and re-processing expired buns. The company ordered the employees to add artificial flavorings and ingredients according to "general feeling" as the cost was cheaper than purchasing real products. The scandal was detected when China Central Television (CCTV) sent an undercover reporter into the factory following up on complaints about the buns.

Ccoa shells were apparently added to substitute wholly or in part for the valuable constituents in the products such as chocolate coating and cocoa liquor. Moreover, it was found that due to excessive amount of cocoa shells, the valuable constituent of cocoa liquor and cocoa fat had been wholly or in part abstracted. 104 cases of chocolate coating and 28 cases of cocoa liquor were seized.

VTens of thousands of bottles with cheap table wine were labeled and sold as highly respected and expensive Italian wines such as Chianti Classico and Brunello di Montalcino. Genuine Chianti and Brunello usually trade for up to £100 a bottle, while the counterfeit wine costed perpetrators as little as one euro per liter. Besides Chianti and Brunello, fake Sagrantino di Montefalco and Bocelli wines were also sold on the market. It was estimated that the counterfeit wines were sold at a price ten times higher than the wines\u2019 real value. If not prosecuted, the perpetrators would have received hundreds of thousands of euros in profit. As a result of operation, more than 30,000 bottles of fake wine were seized.

VIn March 1916, the shipment of an article labeled as "Carnival Brand Cocoa" was seized due to the adulteration of the product. Microscopic examination found that the product, labeled as cocoa, consisted of at least 35% of cocoa shells (a by-product of cocoa production typically sold at a much lower price). The product was determined to be adulterated due to the fact that cocoa shells "injuriously affected the strength and quality" of the cocoa. It was also determined that the product was misleading to customers due to being labeled as "cocoa" while it was actually a blend of cocoa and cocoa shells. The perpetrator pleaded guilty and paid a $25 fine.

Of 33 fillets labelled as "surubim" (Pseudoplastytoma fasciatum), 58% were actually fillets made from species that do not belong to the Pseudoplastytoma genus. Researchers also suggested that, at the time of purchase, the market price for surubim fillets was $14.59/kg, while prices for the substitute species were as low as $5.63/kg, providing evidence for the economic motives of the perpetrators.

The rest of the mislabeled sample were collected from retail locations. Researchers indicated that some of the collected fish species were substituted with less expensive species, while others may have been substituted for marketing reasons.

VA consumer submitted samples of 5-ounce cans of StarKist Chunk Light Tuna in Water, Chunk Light Tuna in Vegetable Oil, Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, and Solid White Albacore Tuna in Vegetable Oil for testing in an independent laboratory. The analysis revealed that all tuna cans were underweight. The largest discrepancy in weight occurred in Chunk Light Tuna in Water. According to the federal minimum standard of fill, the can was supposed to contain at least 2.84 ounces of pressed cake tuna while in reality there was only 2.35 ounces of tuna in the can. Other tuna varieties were underweight by 1.1% to 6.8% by mass. With the millions of tuna cans sold by StarKist annually, under-filling cans by a small percentage could yield substantial economic benefits. Though StarKist denied that they were intentionally under-filling cans, the company agreed to reimburse its customers with either $25 in cash or $50 in coupons.

VA study published in Food Research International reported that out of 45 samples of shark labeled and sold as "palombo" collected in various Italian fish markets, 34 were adulterated with cheaper species. It is reported that the shark species used to substitute were traded at prices as low as \u20ac3.00/kg, while the genuine palombo fillets were sold at \u20ac7.26/kg. Such price discrepancy signified strong economic motives behind the adulteration.

VAt Shutki Polli, which is one of the busiest dried fish markets in Bangladesh, about 1,000 kilogrammes of dried fish adulterated with poisonous chemicals and colors were seized. In addition, several sacks of expired colour-mixed salt were also found and destroyed later. Six unscrupulous were fined for fish adulteration. Officials indicated that colors were added to the fish to attract customers, while chemicals like formalin were used to preserve fish from spoiling; the ultimate goal was to boost sales and receive higher profits.

VIn Poland, a transshipment scheme was uncovered. Garlic was initially transported from China to Rotterdam in deep-sea vessels. There, it was declared as onions and shipped further to Poland. After being cleared in Poland as fresh onions, the garlic was distributed on the Polish market. Most likely, the adulteration was triggered by high additional duties imposed on Chinese garlic. As a result of the operation, the Polish police confiscated 144 tonnes of smuggled garlic.

VAs a result of operation "Leite Adulterado III" (Adulterated Milk III) conducted by Special Action Group for Combating Organized Crime (GAECO), 21 people are suspected of involvement in adulteration of milk and linked to 11 milk businesses based in Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina. Officials admit that the prosecution of companies should be investigated because they might have been unaware of the poor quality of the acquired milk.

VAs a result of campaigns Leite Adulterado I e II (Adulterated Milk I and II) coordinated by Grupo de Atuação Especial de Combate às Organizações Criminosas (GAECO), major milk adulteration incidents were discovered. A total of 48 people suspected of participating in milk adulteration in Western Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul were arrested. Paved Big Dairy and Dairy Mondai Ltda were reported to be involved in the adulteration actions since 2013 and 2008, respectively. Analyses showed that milk was diluted with water to increase its volume. Caustic soda, hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde were added to mask poor quality and increase its shelf life.

V153 out of 165 samples of Heineken beer sold in the Vietnamese metro were diluted with Saigon beer. Police found that only 1/3 of the adulterated Heineken beer was made with genuine Heineken, while 2/3 of the beer was made from cheaper Saigon beer produced in Vietnam. This adulteration scheme made it harder to differentiate fake and authentic Heineken. Police caught the criminals while they were loading cases of the beer into a truck. No illnesses or deaths were reported. The adulterated beer was confiscated.

Zam Zam water comes from a well in Makkah and is holy to those of Islamic faith. It is illegal to export and sell the water from Saudi Arabia, but because of its precious nature people are willing to break the law. The water was tested during the investigation and found to contain high levels of nitrate and potentially harmful bacteria, as well as traces of arsenic at three times the permitted maximum level. No illnesses or deaths were recorded.

VAlcoholic beverages made form antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), formalin and molasses are being sold in Kenya as brand name alcoholic beverages. The ARVs, which are used to prolong lives of people with HIV, produce similar symptoms to alcohol, like those of a hangover, and the formalin helps the body metabolize the drink quickly, causing one to feel the effects faster. With that in mind, some women suffering from HIV decided to use these pills to produce alcohol. The alcohol was then put in used bottles scavenged from dumps with stolen labels from actual alcohol producing companies and resealed to appear normal. A monthly supply of sixty pills from people infected with HIV was bought for about $26, while the revenue from the alcohol was about $100. It is unknown how many illness or deaths this adulteration has caused.

VIn Isreal, Shkedia Extra Virgin "Olive Oil" brand was found to violate the Israel standard #191 for such oil products. The Health Ministry service sent bottles of the oil for testing at its own Haifa lab, as well as the Chemiservice Lab in Italy and the Agroleico Lab. The results were examined along with Israeli experts in olive oil who found that the product was adulterated with cheaper oils. Oil samples were obtained in the Shkedia stand at Supersol Deal and the Yishpro Center in Modi\u2019in. According to Jerusalem Post, the brand was found to misrepresent the labeled product: "Shkedia Extra Virgin Olive Oil, maximum acidity 0.8%, made via cold press, 750 ml, manufactured by ZNT for Shkediya Geva Industries Ltd, Kibbutz Geva, without additives or preservatives, filled on 20.04.15, use until 20.4.16."

VSudan 1 dye was discovered in over 600 food products containing chili powder throughout Europe and North America; the chili powder was used in the production of Worcestershire sauce, which was subsequently used as an ingredient in the affected products. Often, chili powder fades to a brown color with age, but using the Sudan 1 dye preserved the red color making the chili powder appear fresher. Sudan 1 is generally used as an industrial dye to color leather, waxes, oils, petrol, and floor polishes. It is classified as a category 3 carcinogen and not approved for human consumption. The contaminated chili powder was traced back to Indian companies based out of Mumbai. The adulteration was detected in France by analyzing the chili powder powder, and also detected in Italy by analyzing the Worcestershire sauce.

VIn the United States, Beech-Nut sold fraudulent apple juice marketed to infants from 1978-1983, and executives were found guilty of violating Federal laws in 1988. The company began buying apple juice concentrate at below-market value from a supplier (Interjuice) in 1977. Shortly thereafter, chemists within Beech-Nut suspected the concentrate was adulterated. Following multiple concurrent investigations by Beech-Nut chemists, U.S. FDA, and an apple trade association that indicated definitive adulteration, Beech-Nut executives ceased buying concentrate from Interjuice. However, they did not issue an immediate recall of the adulterated products. No illness or deaths were reported.

VAlmost 300,000 infants became ill and 6 died as a result of 22 Chinese food companies selling milk products, including infant formula, that were adulterated with melamine and likely diluted with water. The adulteration was detected after many infants developed kidney stones and parents complained to a large infant formula producer in China. Melamine was added to milk to artificially increase the apparent protein content. Melamine adulteration was eventually detected in many food products, and adulterated dry milk supplies have been detected multiple times since the adulteration incident was uncovered. It is suspected that the case might have started as early as 2005.

Mixed meat can result from improperly cleaned meat grinders, but may also be intentional when the price of beef exceeds the price of other meats. The incident was discovered as part of a Florida Department of Agriculture survey which determined that 26 out of 90 sampled supermarkets and butcher shops sold "mixed meat" labeled as ground beef.

VLarge olive oil scam was discovered in Italy. Italy\u2019s forestry police unraveled the scheme, which involved 12 companies in Puglia, Italy, and a certification laboratory. Tons of olive oil were imported from Syria, Turkey, Morocco, and Tunisia and then sold as authentic Italian extra-virgin olive oil. Millions of euros were earned by the perpetrators from selling the fake olive oil to consumers from Italy, United States and Japan. The adulteration was likely triggered by the bad olive harvest which occurred in 2014 and led to production decline and unusually high olive oil prices. Though there is no direct connection yet, but this incident might be connected with a recently discovered case of adulteration in Italy in which famous brand producers were falsely passing off inferior olive oil products as \u201cextra-virgin.\u201d

VThe Federal Commission for Protection Against Health Risks (COFEPRIS) , in coordination with the Attorney General's Office and the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock , Fisheries and Food detected illegal use of clenbuterol to fatten cattle in Veracruz. The health authority ordered the quarantine of 1,400 kilograms of beef and the destruction of more than 1,050 kilograms. 72 blood and urine samples taken and analyzed in the pens by mobile units, and seven samples from six different feeders resulted positive for the use of clenbuterol, so the health authority requested the intervention of the Federal Public Ministry of illegal presumption.

VIn Uganda, 10 milk vendors were found guilty of selling milk diluted with water and hydrogen peroxide. The adulteration was discovered in a joint operation by the Diary Development Authority personnel and police after receiving several complaints from residents about poor milk quality. The officials impounded a total of 500 liters of adulterated milk. The incentive for adulteration may have been an active growth in milk consumption rates among Ugandans (per capita consumption of milk grew from 46 liters in 2013 to 60 liters in 2015).

They sold foreign farm-raised shrimp falsely labeled as U.S. wild caught shrimp and sold shrimp that falsely claimed to be larger and more expensive than they actually were. Some of the fish tested positive for malachite green and Enrofloxin, both of which are considered health hazards and banned from U.S. food products. Blyth and Phelps were co-owners of Consolidated Seafood Enterprises Inc., in Phoenix and Reel Fish and Seafood Inc., in Pensacola, Florida. The Reel Fish company also took expired oysters and re-dated their tags (mislabeling).

VMalachite green chloride is a triphenylmethane dye used in the fish and dye industries. It is highly toxic to mammalian cells; it promotes hepatic tumor formation in rodents and also causes reproductive abnormalities in rabbits and fish. The structural similarity of malachite green to other carcinogenic triphenylmethane dyes also raises suspicion of carcinogenicity. Based on the potential for adverse human health effects, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nominated malachite green as a priority chemical for carcinogenicity testing by the National Toxicology Program in 1993.

Samples of the adulterated ice cream were collected for analysis. Preliminary data suggests that the ice cream was made from adulterated khoya and/or mawa. While more precise results are being awaited, the local ice cream manufacturer, Chunna Khan, his sons Idris and Rais and Komal Chand Jain, a trader of 'mawa' (a milk product), were arrested.

VActing on a tip, FDA officials seized a large stock of refined edible oil in Pune, India. The trader was blending cheap edible oil (such as palm oil) with sunflower and soybean oil to increase the volume; yet, the adulterated oil was sold as it was pure sunflower oil or soybean oil. This act of oil adulteration aimed to mislead consumers and earn extra profit for the treader.

VIn 2014, an animal feed adulteration act was prosecuted by FDA. Shur-Green Farms was found guilty in obtaining lascadoil, which is an industrial waste byproduct for fuel use only, and selling it as soy oil, which was used as animal feed for turkeys and swines. Though the company claimed that the the "soy oil" was recycled restaurant oil, it was determined that lascadoil contained lascalocid sodium, a substace that is used as an animal drug, in concentrations ranging from 0.028 to 1642 parts per million. According to FDA, there is no evidence that this drug can be used as a food additive thus making the lascadoil unfit for animal consumption. The adulteration entailed loss of 57,700 turkeys. It also resulted in 35,900 head of swine being held from market for 29 days and the land filling of over 500 tons of withdrawn contaminated feed.

VAfter being found innocent with regard to horse meat which happened in the UK in 2013, Farmbox Meats company was investigated further. According to the prosecution, 19 boxes of goat meat falsely labelled as lamb or mutton meat were found at Farmbox Meats. This mislabeled meat was marketed as genuine British lamb despite the fact that the meat was slaughtered, sealed, and packaged abroad. Another violation that comes along with this adulteration is that the company failed to comply with the rule that food should be traceable from the farmyard to the fork. The records kept in Farmbox Meats were found "extremely negligent." As a result of investigation, the owner and the manager of the company were arrested and pleaded guilty.

The firm was processing chicken, beef, and pork products from federally inspected establishments and re-packaging them such that the products were inspected by USDA even though no such inspection was conducted. Thus, the unauthorized use of a USDA mark of inspection could potentially mislead consumers to buying unsafe food products. The various poultry, beef and pork items were produced between May 18, 2014, and May 18, 2015. Approximately 213,192 pounds of such products are demanded to be recalled due to misbranding.

VHawaiian Kona coffee farmers filed and won a class action law-suit against multiple coffee companies for intentionally mislabeling and selling Central American coffee beans as "Pure Kona Coffee." "Kona" coffee refers to arabica coffee grown in certain specified areas in Hawaii, and is one of the most expensive types of coffee. By mislabeling the packaging, the perpetrators were able to increase their prices and retain the extra profit. The mislabeling was discovered after the owner of Kona Kai Farms was indicted on charges of money laundering and wire fraud.

VRobert Randazzo, president of New England Shrimp Co. was convicted of selling shrimp that had been illegally treated with saccharin and other chemicals to customers throughout the United States. Shrimp was treated with STP to absorb water and increase the weight of the shrimp, leading to increased profits. Also, Randazzo used sodium hydroxide, also known as soda lye and caustic soda, to turn white and Black Tiger shrimp imported from China, Thailand and other countries into pink shrimp appearing to be from the Gulf of Mexico in order to meet customer preference for pink shrimp from the United States. Further, Randazzo treated shrimp with saccharin to cover-up the undesirable taste created by excessive use of salt in its shrimp to increase the shrimp's weight. He did not label the package accordingly, which is illegal.

VThe Hong Kong Health Department released test results showing that eight types of freshwater fish imported from China contained malachite green. Malachite green may be carcinogenic and its use in aquaculture has been banned in many countries including the US and the UK. China banned malachite green in 2002, but its use persists because of it antibacterial properties. With out the use of antibacterial agents fish farmers lose higher percentages of their populations so there is an economic incentive to use malachite green.

VIn UK, 14 Chilean wines were discovered to contain unacceptable levels of sorbitol. Sorbitol is a sweetener found naturally in apple or pear juice but banned from wine because it can change the flavor. The high levels of sorbitol suggested that fruit juice or sorbitol itself was added to increase wine volume and change wine flavor. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Food found this issue during tests and local authorities investigated the incident of adulteration.

VTurkey withdrew and replaced millions of bottles of raki, a traditional anise-flavored distilled alcohol, after it was discovered that approximately 500,000 genuine "Yeni Raki" brand labels, including the tax hologram, were stolen from a bottling facility in Izmir. . The counterfeit raki contained over 200 times the legal limit of methyl alcohol. The counterfeit was detected due to many human illnesses of which 23 were lethal. Police raided cities across Turkey to seize the counterfeit bottles of raki. Also, Mey Drinks, an official distributor of Yeni Raki, recalled millions of bottles from shops and markets and destroyed them.

VIn Vietnam, villagers produced fake rice alcohol and wine from industrial alcohol (presumably, a form of distilled ethyl alcohol) combined with water and fragrance. The process of producing fake alcohol is much more efficient than traditional methods. Adulteration of the alcoholic beverages is potentially harmful to human health and has led to disappearance of traditional distilleries in Vietnam.

Some of the products used the New Zealand Fern Mark Logo, a New Zealand Government commercial trademark. The mislabeling may have been motivated by Chinese consumer mistrust of domestically-produced infant formula following the melamine adulteration scandal. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has engaged with Chinese officials to resolve the issue.

A total of 1,200 - 1,500 kg of curry was destroyed after Sudan IV was detected at the factory. The Spice Board conducted the raid based on information received from international regulatory sources. No illnesses or deaths were identified as part of this investigation.

VTipped by an 'insider', Italian anti-Mafia and tax investigators 18 000 tonnes of virgin olive oil with an estimated value of Lit80bn (or $50 million) in the Puglia and Calabria Regions of southern Italy. It was revealed that the adulterated oil was labeled as extra virgin oil olive even though it contained only 5% of the claimed substance. The other 95% of the volume was made up from cheap lower quality oils such as seed oil. A total of 30 executives of 10 different companies were accused in extra virgin oil adulteration.

VIn response to the on-going concern about lamb dilution in UK takeaways, FSA sampled 307 lamb containing dishes including but are not limited to Indian style takeaway meals, lamb kebabs, oriental style takeaway meals, and other style takeaway meals. As the result of investigation, 65 samples were found to contain meats other than lamb. Furthermore, 42 samples contained various proportions of beef, chicken, pork, and turkey which in total accounted for more than 1% of the meat sample. Despite the mislabeled meat, some analyzed meals also contained traces of undeclared allergens and colors. Though officials suspect that the allergens (peanuts and almonds) and colors (Sunset Yellow, or E110, and Ponceau 4R, or E124) were in the meals as a result of cross contamination and improper handling techniques, these additives might have adversely influenced the health of the with allergies.

VGerman and Dutch companies were accused in butter transshipment scheme. The companies utilized Estonia's access to European Union (EU) markets to avoid paying high tariffs. Thus, the butter which originated from EU was relabeled as Estonian butter and imported by Germany. The adulteration was uncovered as a result of the development of new tests aimed to assess authenticity of foods. These tests revealed that the "Estonian" butter had traces of maize which is fed to herds in the EU but not to those in Estonia.

VThe Food Standards Agency of the U.K. issued a recall notice for palm oil that was adulterated with Sudan IV. Despite presence of Sudan IV, the ingredient statement on the oil, which is branded as Fovitor Dzomi Palm Oil, stated: "Ingredients: Palm Fruit, Salt and Water (No added colour)." The manufacturer of the oil, Fovitor International Limited, wasn't the direct producer of the oil. Rather, the oil was purchased from Miva Lifeline Limited, the company that supplied the oil from Ghana. It was revealed that Miva Lifeline Limited did not possess the appropriate certification for legal distribution of palm oil. Nevertheless, Sudan IV is a commonly used substance employed to artificially enhance the reddish color of the palm oil and make it more applicable to the consumers.

VSamples of oregano spice from a range of shops in the UK and Ireland and from online retailers were examined by Professor Chris Elliott, the director of the Institute for Global Food Security. The study found 19 out of 78 samples of the herb were diluted with other ingredients, most commonly olive and myrtle leaves. The adulterated samples contained 30% to 70% of the non-oregano materials. Though the retailers of the adulterated oregano spice as well as the brand names were not revealed but rather passed to the Food Standards Agency, the experts admit that this type of adulteration cannot be spotted by an average consumer without specially designed tests.

VIn India, a man was accused in selling heavily diluted milk as Amul, Gokul, and Mahananda branded milk. The man would buy branded milk from shops, or collect empty packets from tea shops and garbage bins and then fill them up with milk diluted with impure water. It was found that the perpetrator was diluting every 3 parts of milk with 10 parts of water. The adulterated milk was supplied to a hotel and several vendors in the local area. As a result of the raid to the perpetrator's residence, the police seized 57 litres of Gokul milk and 66 litres of Amul milk.

VAJ\u2019s Fine Foods, the Arizona-based retailer (operated by Bashas\u2019 Inc), was accused of selling meat which was diluted with additional lower cost meats. Consequently, customers paid more for lower quality meats. This adulteration took place at AJ\u2019s locations in the Phoenix area and one in Tucson between January 2010 and February 2012. In the statement, Bashas\u2019 outlined two specific wrongs: First, meat department members at some AJ\u2019s stores mislabeled USDA Choice steaks as USDA Prime (a higher grade that costs more, resulting in customers being overcharged). Secondly, meat department members at some AJ\u2019s stores added cuts of expensive prime and choice steak to American-style Kobe ground beef in order to improve the consistency of the grind. Overall, the company will be paying $1.4 million to area food banks as restitution and plan on disciplining or firing the workers responsible for mislabeling.

VThe Tainan City Government Health Bureau conducted tests on breakfast store hamburger patties in Tainan, Taiwan. The bureau\u2019s report on 108 hamburger patties, collected from 81 breakfast stores in Tainan over six months showed that about 47 percent of \u201cpork patties\u201d contained beef, 50 percent of \u201cchicken patties\u201d contained pork, and about 30 percent of \u201cbeef patties\u201d contained pork. Among the breakfast stores examined, 70 percent were individual stores and 30 percent were branches of breakfast chain stores. The Bureau's Deputy Director-General (\u9ec3\u6587\u6b63) said the samples were collected by bureau staff acting as consumers, not through a formal inspection procedure, adding that further tests were required and that fines would not be imposed on patty manufacturers.

VRaki, which is a popular aniseed-flavored spirit in Turkey, was adulterated with methanol. Methanol is a non-food grade substance with alike properties to ethanol. It is commonly used instead of ethanol to decrease the production costs. Yet, methanol is detrimental to the humans' health and cannot be used in foods by law. The investigation about the fake raki is ongoing. Thousands of fake bottles of raki were seized in several operations across the country. A total of 15 people have been arrested to date. Some of the perpetrators claim that the adulteration took place due to illicit sale of methanol instead of ethanol by the bulk alcohol distributors. The economical motives of this adulteration are explicit considering very high alcohol taxes in Turkey and the fact that methanol is a cheaper substance than ethanol.

VDNA analysis conducted by Oceana shows that 38% of seafood tested in Brussels are mislabeled. Oceana\u2019s study reveals that economic reasons are the main driver behind the seafood fraud, resulting in consumer deception. Expensive species, such as cod or sole, are sold for as much as 30 or 40 euros per dish, and can be substituted by cheap farmed Pangasius. The top 3 fraudulent species found are Bluefin tuna, common sole and cod. In 95% of cases, expensive Bluefin Tuna was sold as Bigeye tuna or Yellowfin tuna (both are cheaper tropical tuna species). Whereas, in 11% of cases, Sole was substituted for another cheaper flatfish species. Lastly, 13% of Cod species were substituted for different species; most often being Pangasius or saithe.

Their findings exposed frequent cases of confusing product names; incomplete labels which fail to highlight added water; use of illegal food additives; use of undeclared mechanically-separated meat and fraudulent use of other species as a substitute, e.g. turkey kebab sold as veal.

VGame meats are popular in South Africa due to being considered as a healthy alternative to beef. Yet, the unscrupulous traders tend to substitute the expensive game meat with cheaper kinds. Researchers form the University of the Western Cape investigated this issue and revealed that out of 146 samples of the acquired meat products, only 45 were labeled correctly. When the beef samples are excluded from the count, the rates of adulteration increase significantly. Thus, out of 132 samples of the game meat 101 were not genuine. Moreover, 43 of the samples that were found to be adulterated used beef meat as a substituent. In addition, meats from kangaroo and giraffe, which are not commonly traded in the market, were also used to adulterate the game meats.

VIn this study, conducted by Oceana, the Danish newspaper Søndagsavisen, and the TV program \u201cGo\u2019Aften Denmark\u201d found that there is a high level of sea fraud in Danish markets. In total, 120 samples from fishmongers, supermarkets, and restaurants in the wider Copenhagen region underwent DNA analysis. The study that 18 percent of cod sold in fishmongers is not indeed cod, but actually haddock or saithe. Even though haddock and saithe are closely related to cod, it is still fraudulent to sell these species as cod. These two species are cheaper than cod, which results in monetary loss for the consumer and monetary gain for the seller.

VApproximately, 143 people are known to have died after consuming a batch of home-brewed liquor laced with the highly toxic chemicals: methanol and ammonium nitrate. This incident occured in India's West Bengal state. Residents of 12 villages fell ill after drinking the alcohol and a total of ten people have been arrested. Doctors in the area found methanol \u2014 a type of industrial-strength alcohol used as anti-freeze or fuel \u2014 in the remains of 20 of the victims, leading to suspicion the chemical is to blame. It is sometimes added to \u201cmoonshine\u201d in small quantities to increase the alcohol content, but can cause blindness, liver damage and be fatal.

VOceana\u2019s study covered the major shrimp-producing states in the Gulf of Mexico, Portland, OR, Washington, D.C. and New York City in 2013. They found that 30 percent of the 143 shrimp products tested from 111 vendors visited were misrepresented. A total of 15% were substituted which means that they were the wrong species. For example \u201crock\u201d shrimp was replaced with white leg shrimp. Whereas, a total of 10 percent were misleading: they were labeled as coming from a region in the U.S. known for wild-caught shrimp, but were identified as farmed white leg shrimp which is farmed worldwide. Lastly, 5 percent were diluted with different shrimp species.

VOf the 217 samples taken for testing from milk collection centres, tankers, processing units, local dairies and vendors in Pune, Kolhapur, Solapur, Satara and Sangli, 60 were found to be substandard and 20 were found unsafe for human consumption. According to Indian standards, milk is considered unsafe when a substance is added directly or as an ingredient which is not permitted. In the present incident, adulterants like skimmed milk powder, sugar and edible oil were detected in the milk sample signifying it was unsafe for human consumption. These adulterant were used to enhance appearance and taste of the milk. Moreover, there were milk samples that lacked in standards of fat and 'solids not fat' (SNF) content. Likely, this took place due to the dilution of milk with water. As a result of the investigation that was going on between April 1, 2013 and October 31, 2013, 13 people were prosecuted under various provisions of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.

VClenbuterol, a banned pig-feed additive, was produced and fed to pigs in China and the meat from these pigs was processed and sold to Chinese consumers in Jiangsu and Henan provinces. Clenbuterol was used to burn fat and accelerate muscle-building in swine. Experts cited the size of the Chinese agricultural sector and presence of "loopholes" in random sample inspection as reasons why clenbuterol use went undetected. The incident was made public following a television report on widespread clenbuterol use.

VExcessive levels of iodine in soy milk caused thyroid related illness at least 56 people in Australia and more than 600 people got sick. The levels of iodine were 1000 times more than safe dosage due to a seaweed used in the production of the product. The manufacturers of Bonsoy soy milk knew about the high levels of iodine as early as 2003 but ignored the results to continue to sell their product. There is a class action lawsuit against the companies.

VCounterfeiters were able to distribute about 400,000 bottles of fake Mont Tauch Fitou AOC wine between 2007 and 2010. The adulteration was discovered after Mont Tauch sales team became aware of multiple reports claiming that the premium Fitou AOC wine was sold at very low prices. Analysis conducted by Mont Tauch revealed that the premium Fitou AOC wine was substituted with a cheap, low quality, bulk wine from South America and then put into bottles with counterfeit trademark.

VLarge quantities of methanol, which was used to increase the alcohol content, were found in wines branded as Odore Barbera and Fraris Dolcetto del Piemonte. The amount of methanol in the wine was almost 20 times higher than the allowable limit. The adulteration was discovered after adverse health incidents were reported. Thus, over 90 people were hospitalized an 24 people died after consuming adulterated Italian wine.

VActing on a tip, NAFDAC confiscated 314 cartons of counterfeit Kasapreko Alomo Bitters from an unapproved and illegal production factory. A Nigerian native was arrested and two other people are under investigation. Alomo Bitters counterfeit is a big issue in Nigeria since the demand for this product is quite high. Widespread of the adulteration prevents Kasapreko Co., a Ghana based producer of genuine Alomo Bitters, from investing into further expansion of Alomo Bitters production in Nigeria. To prevent adulteration, Kasapreko plans to stamp holographic materials on the product.

The suspects where taken while producing the fake beverages. Over N25 million (about $160,000) worth of the product was seized during the raid. Increased popularity of Alomo Bitters in Nigeria as well as unprotected and easy-to-fake labels might have been triggers for this adulteration.

VIn 2014, Body Fortress, a company specialized in producing protein sports drinks, was sued for mislabeling its products. The lawsuit claimed that 8.5 grams of out of 30 grams of Body Fortress Super Advanced Whey Protein were spiked with different forms of amino acids. The lawsuit explains that amino acids, although the building blocks of protein, did not offer the same nutritional benefits as complete proteins. Amino acids were generally less expensive than whey (and other complete proteins) and therefore could be used as fillers. Consumers were mislead about the amount of protein contained in the products.

The second instance, which happened in July 2007, was almost identical to the first one: the owner of Venkata Janardhana Home Needs Shop also sold an adulterated grain to customers. Both cases took place in Gajuwaka. On January 28th, 2015, the perpetrators were penalized with a fine of Rs. 5,000 and sentenced to two years of imprisonment.

VA US dairy farm in Washington State administered antibiotics to cows in a manner that was contrary to labeled directions, without the guidance of a licensed veterinarian, and without the proper drug withdrawal time before cows were sent to slaughter. These actions led to illegal residues of four different antibiotics in the farm's cattle: flunixin, penicillin, sulfadimethoxine and tetracycline. The incident was first discovered by the FDA through routine inspections in 2004, but legal action was not taken by the FDA until 2011.

Pig hearts were sold as sheep, veal, or beef hearts and labeled halal and non-halal chicken was labeled as halal. Expired turkeys were re-labeled to indicate that they had not expired. Three informants notified the authorities of the mislabeling and a formal investigation was launched.

VIn China, it was estimated that almost 10% of the country's cooking oil contained discarded oil illegally gathered from drains and "recycled". This "gutter" or "swill" oil was filtered and re-sold to restaurants across China. Photos leaked in 2009 led to an investigation and crackdown resulting in arrests in 2011. Those involved in 'gutter oil' were difficult to identify because they were hiding in various regions. Because various administrations, such as health, industrial and commercial departments, were not supervising the disposal of oil, restaurant owners attempted to make profit quickly on used oil. Purchasers of used oils were able to purchase refined "gutter" oil for less than legitimate oils.

VFormaldehyde-soaked straw and termite mushrooms were found to be very prevalent in a random test done by the Thai Food and Drug Administration. Formaldehyde is commonly used to adulterate fish for extended preservation and moisture retention, but in mushrooms it is also being used to prevent fruit fly eggs from hatching and destroying the mushrooms. Some mushrooms, such as shiitake mushrooms naturally produce formaldehyde at low levels, but the levels of formaldehyde in the tested mushrooms were much higher. The Thai Ministry of Public Health encouraged consumers to wash and cook the mushrooms before consuming them, as there is a large reduction in formaldehyde after 6 minutes of cooking. Formaldehyde is not an approved food additive in the United States, and a safe level is not defined.

Officials report that 778 container loads of honey were transshipped to the US. Individual actors were fined and sentenced to imprisonment. The adulteration was motivated by strict antidumping policies and high import taxes imposed on otherwise cheap Chinese honey.

VMaleic anhydride, an industrial chemical not approved for use in food products, was added to modified starch powder in Taiwan. Levels of maleic anhydride in the starch powder reportedly reached almost 5,000 ppm. This imparted texture and mouth feel to foods in which the starch powder was used ("chewiness"). The adulteration was detected by the Tainan District Prosecutors Office and nine people were prosecuted. Approximately 19 million kilograms of the fraudulent starch was sold, earning the manufacturing firms NT$478 million (US$15.8 million).

The adulteration was discovered when the rates of manuka honey sold where compared to the production rates. It turned out that the amount of true manuka honey constituted only 17% of the total manuka honey sale. Analysis revealed that manuka honey was adulterated with syrup and other sorts of cheap honey.

VLead chromate was found in turmeric powder from Bangladesh. Lead chromate is a coloring agent that is not present in the environment naturally and must be both synthesized and added on purpose. Its use as a coloring agent could be masking further adulteration, or just be making the product more attractive for consumers. The amount of lead in the product, 40-58ppm, exceeds Bangladesh's limit of 2.5 ppm. The product was recalled both in Bangladesh and the United States after the New York State Health Department and a private laboratory tested the product. Four U.S companies recalled product.

VA coloring agent, sodium copper chlorophyllin, was found in instant spinach noodles. The sodium/copper derivative is the common form of chlorophyllin used as a legal food additive in other foods, but is not authorized for use in noodles. It is not identified why the coloring agent was used, but it would contribute to the green color that the spinach containing noodles would have, possibly masking discoloration or other defect. The company was fined by the local Health Bureau and products were removed from the shelves.

VIn Auchan, a huge food retailer chain in Russia, utilization of expired meat products was observed by Russian food regulator Rosselkhoznadzor. In particular, pizza produced in Auchan on July 20th, 2015 contained smoked sausage product "pepperoni" with a shelf life of up to July 5th, 2015. Such act is a sever violation of the Federal Law of 02.01.2000 \u211629-FZ "On quality and food safety." Auchan's representatives confirmed presence of the expired smoked sausage in their refrigerators, yet, they claim that the sausage was assigned for disposal.

VInvestigation by Russian food regulator Rosselkhoznadzor of hypermarket chain Auchan revealed that the fresh meat supplied to retailer was mislabeled with respect to its expiration dates. Despite the fact that by the law meat is considered safe for human consumption during 24 - 48 hours period, the meat labels in Auchan suggested that the meat products were safe for 48 - 72 hours. Considering that the meat was simply cut and packaged and no other treatments were performed, it is very likely that the meat products were mislabeled in order to bring additional profits to the retailer. Almost 250 kg of the adulterated products were seized by the authorities.

VTuna, seer fish, pomfret, mackerel, red snapper, ray fish, sardine, and bengal carp, as well as ice that fish is stored on have been adulterated with formalin across the Indian state of Kerala. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Formalin is a preservative and keeps old, or low quality fish looking and smelling more appetizing. The samples collected were in a variety of forms including dried and iced as well as samples of the ice the fish were in. The Indian Food Safety Comissionerate collected the samples; it is unknown how the adulteration was detected.

VSamples of groundnut oil were found to be diluted with palm oil in Ahmedabad, India. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Imported palm oil costs less than groundnut oil. It is difficult for consumers to detect the adulteration because the palm oil is colorless and mixes easily with the groundnut oil. The Indian Food and Drug Administration tested over 900 samples for adulteration and found 140 samples from various unnamed brands.

VCheaper Vietnamese rice was being mixed with Taiwanese rice and being sold as 100% Taiwanese by one of Taiwan's three major rice distributors. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Vietnamese rice is cheaper to procure as it is considered to be of lower quality than Taiwanese rice. The dilution was discovered by the Taiwanese Council of Agriculture during one of its inspections. This discovery prompted more frequent inspections of rice labels.

VVietnamese catfish, also known as pangasius or basa, was preserved with formalin. No illnesses or deaths were reported. It is the most commonly farmed fish in Asia. The formalin is added because it took about a week to reach Punjab, where it will be sold. It reduced storage and labor costs when the fish already preserved. It is then sold for more than locally acquired fish in the Punjab area because the pangasius harder to procure fresh. Local Punjab fisherman and farmers detected the adulteration.

VJuice in China was made with rotten apples, pears, and possibly other fruit. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Earlier in the season a cold spell and a tornado damaged almost half of the fruit crop, so it was being sold cheaply to canning and juice manufacturing companies. Chinese food safety officials suspended operations of the two companies involved.

VThe Boston Globe conducted an investigation of the moisture content in scallops. A total of 21 samples were collected from Massachusetts supermarkets. The results revealed that some products sold as pure scallops (meaning they were not processed with additives to soak up moisture) contained water levels far exceeding industry standards. For reference, scallops are about 75 percent water when they are harvested from the ocean. Yet, Target\u2019s \u201cwild caught all natural sea scallops\u201d were 85 percent water, while New England Wild Jumbo Scallops at Trader Joe\u2019s were 86 percent water. Seafood specialists say the findings suggest many scallops include additives but are packaged without any labeling to indicate the treatments. There are some signs that suggest scallops may have been treated, for example, excess water leaches out when cooked and discolorations might appear.

The raid was made on a tip-off and resulted in seizure of 13,000 liters of adulterated milk, 450 kg of synthetic powder, 1,000 liters of refined oil, and more than 135 kg of various food additives. The perpetrators used to mix all these ingredients into milk-like looking mixture and then sold it as a genuine milk.

VConsumers who bought honey along Harare-Mutare Road in Marondera, Zimbabwe were left counting their losses after discovering they received diluted honey products. Investigations by NewsDay revealed that vendors purchased low-cost sugar and mixed it with water to make a sticky sugar solution or sugar syrup which resembles honey in appearance. Adultered honey can be found at nearly every black market in Marondera town, and it is increasingly becoming difficult to differentiate it from the genuine honey because the packaging is the same. Vendors have resorted to mixing sugar syrup and honey due to the migration of bees in Zimbabwe. Therefore, they sell adultered honey to maintain their profits.

VThe Health nutritionist, Violet Kadzora, urged the public in Zimbabwe to be wary of fake honey on the market stating that sugar itself posed a serious health hazard. An influx of sugar into the bloodstream upsets the body\u2019s blood-sugar balance, triggering the release of insulin, which the body uses to keep blood-sugar at a constant and safe level. Insulin also promotes the storage of fat, so that when you eat sweets high in sugar, you\u2019re making way for rapid weight gain and elevated triglyceride levels, both of which have been linked to cardiovascular disease. Complex carbohydrates tend to be absorbed more slowly, lessening the impact on blood-sugar levels.

VBergamot peel oil is a valuable product for its olfactory properties and high commercial value. It has many clinical uses, for example, it can be used as a malaria remedy additionally it can produce a sedative effect with somnolence, lowered heart and breathing rate. Unfortunately, industrial or commercial operators resort to adulterating bergamot oil to increase their overall profits. The first information on bergamot adulteration is given by De Domenico (1854). He reported the addition to cold-extracted bergamot oil of a mixture obtained with \u201cturpentine\u201d (an essential oil extracted from the pine tree also known as turpentine oil) and sweet orange or lemon oils or oils obtained by distillation or cold extraction of unripe fruits of bergamot (called bergamottella prematurely fallen from the trees.

VIn India, the illegal producers of adulterated spices were prosecuted. Rajesh Gupta and 20 of his workers were caught adulterating poppy seeds, black pepper, and cumin. The perpetrators used a variety of chemicals and different adulterating techniques to dilute genuine spices and enhance their appearance. For example, officials determined that every 10 kg of black paper were in fact diluted with three to four kg of colored papaya seeds. The adulterated black pepper would then be sold for Rs.450 per kg to wholesalers, who, in turn, would sell the dangerous mixture at around Rs.1,000. To adulterate poppy seeds, the perpetrators used died low-quality semolina (suji) along with a mix of glue to increase its weight and make the final product visually attractive. The investigation is still ongoing and aims to determine which wholesalers that were buying the adulterated species made by Gupta and then repackaging them under several brand names.

VDuring the summer season, when milk production is low and the demand is high, adulteration is a major problem in the fluid milk supply in Pakistan. Milk suppliers increase their margin from the sale of milk through dilution, extraction of valuable component (i.e. cream) and use of additives such as low-quality flour to enhance the total solids content. In this study, a total of 300 milk samples were collected. Among all 300 milk samples, water (79.3%) was the most common adulterant found in majority of milk samples followed by detergent (30.3%), cane sugar (22%), starch (18.3%), rice flour (17.7%), skimmed milk powder (15.3%), caustic soda sodium chloride and formalin (14%), hydrogen peroxide (12%), urea and vegetable oil (10.7%), ammonium sulfate and boric acid (8.3%), respectively - Please see the link to the study to see a more comprehensive list.

VThe adulteration of milk deteriorates the overall quality of milk and may cause serious problems for human health. For example, carbonate in milk may produce gastrointestinal problems including gastric ulcer and electrolytes disturbance. While, the hydrogen peroxide disturbs the antioxidants in the body; disturbing the natural immunity hence increasing aging. High level of chloride in the milk disturbs the acid-base balance and blood pH in the body. Formalin affects the optic nerves and causes blindness. Whereas, boric acid causes nausea, kidney damage and acute failure of the circulatory system.

VIn this study, Fish fillets from the two major supplier companies in Pará that were labeled as \u201cpescada branca\u201d and sold in large supermarket chains in Belém, Pará, in the Brazilian Amazon, were collected for analysis. They collected a total of 137 fillet samples used DNA barcoding to analyze whether or not they belonged to the labeled species. DNA barcoding was able to identify 90% of the samples analyzed to the species level, and the results showed a high rate of species substitution in the fillets labeled as \u201cpescada branca\u201d. The substitution rate was 100% if using the criterion that the fillets should be C. leiarchus and 76.6% if using the criterion that they should be P. squamosissimus. Additionally, the results show that \u201cpescada branca\u201d was replaced in most cases by species of lower commercial value, which clearly demonstrates economically motivated adulteration (EMA) aimed at increased profits.

Thus, DNA testing which took place in January 2014 suggests the orange juice branded as Rich was diluted with mandarin juice. Considering that the label on the package claimed that the juice was 100% orange juice, presence of other juices in the product is unacceptable and might have mislead consumers.

VSunflower oil IDEAL was found mislabeled due to its processing conditions. Thus, the producer indicated on the label that the cold press technology was utilized to separate the sediment from the oil. Yet, the testing conducted by Roscontrol discovered presence of waxes in the oil which is not supposed to occur if the cold press technology had been utilized. As a result of such mislabeling, consumers might have been mislead with regard to the quality of the oil. Moreover, the producer might have saved some money due to employment of the technology that did not require low temperatures for oil separation.

VAbkhazian tangerines, which are highly preferred among the Russian consumers and thus sold at premium prices, were substituted with Chinese tangerines. Unscrupulous traders say that the demand for Abkhazian tangerines exceeds the supply. Moreover, Russian consumers prefer to stay away from the fruits produced in China. Both of these factors lead make it very tempting to mislabel the Chinese tangerine as Abkhazian and sell them at premium prices.

VIn South Korea more than 451 tons of beef from the United States was labeled as Australian or South Korean beef. Trends in mislabeling the source of US beef have been tied to the suspension of US beef imports first over the risk of mad cow disease and again after zilpaterol, a feed additive not approved in South Korea, was detected in some US beef. Reports cited the lower cost of US beef as the primary reason behind labeling the US beef as Australian or South Korean beef. The mislabeling was discovered during food inspections.

VIn Taiwain, Sesame oil labeled was diluted with refined cottonseed oil by Flavor Full Food Inc. but was sold as 100% pure. No illness or deaths were reported. Cottonseed oil is of lower quality and is easier to procure; the accused company is one of two importers of crude cottonseed oil in Taiwan. The company is the second largest sesame oil producer in the world, and the largest in Taiwan. The Changhua District Prosecutor's Office began looking at the facility's practices after another producer in the area was caught adulterating its oil. It is estimated that 10.2 million dollars worth of oil was confiscated. In addition the company has admitted to adding additional flavoring to its peanut oil products.

The premium brands are very expensive, often being foreign and imported. The adulteration was detected in a surprise raid by the Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation as a part of a general increase in raids at susceptible locations. Up to 379 people and 1800 vehicles were involved with smuggling or transporting diluted liquor in 2013.

VIn China, cooking oil was produced from meat processing waste, including skins, chicken buttocks, and pig offal. Between January 2011 and March 2012, $9.8 million of adulterated oil was sold to 117 food makers and oil processors before the adulteration was caught. It is unclear how the adulteration was detected, but 16 people were arrested for involvement in the crime and one man was sentenced to life in prison.

VThe Bengal Engineering and Science University and the Times of India conducted nationwide sampling and testing of milk that found adulterants in many of the samples, including cane sugar, cellulose, and sodium chloride (salt). Officials suggest that the milk suppliers were paid based on the amount of the solid non-fat (SNF) content in milk; therefore, there was an incentive to add adulterants like sugar, salt and starch which increase the SNF content.

VDiethylene glycol (DEG) was found in 350 Austrian wines, including at least 35 brands imported into the United States. The chemical was most likely added to improve the body of the wine, and potentially mask the addition of sugar for sweetness. The adulteration was discovered when a tax inspector noticed a wine producer had claimed tax deductions on large quantities of DEG. Several dozen wine producers and dealers were arrested in the incident.

VA new method of rice production was adopted by some Chinese food producers which were creating "rice" out of potatoes, sweet potatoes, and plastic. To create the fake rice, the potatoes material was mixed together and shaped into grains; \u201cindustrial resin\u201d was then added as a binding agent. Officials don't indicate the exact amount of plastic added to the "rice", but they point out that eating three bowls of this fake rice would be equal to eating one plastic bag. There is evident economical motivation behind this food fraud as it was revealed that the "potato-plastic" rice is much cheaper to produce than the authentic rice.

VIn the United Kingdom, 69 products were recalled due to adulteration of spice with Para Red dye. Para Red dye is most commonly used in ink and is banned from use in food. The adulterated spices with Para Red were traced back to Uzbekistan, supplied by a Spanish Company Ramon Sabater, and imported into the UK by supplier Lion Foods. The adulterated spice was mostly found in cooking sauces but also seasonings. The adulteration was identified during an investigation into Sudan I dye adulteration. No illness or death has been reported in association with this event.

VIn India, it was reported that declining production in the Kashmir region due to drought and disease has resulted in increased adulteration in the saffron market. Unnamed agricultural experts reported that Iranian Saffron, which is significantly less expensive, has been sold as Kashmiri saffron and that Kashmiri saffron has been adulterated with unspecified adulterants. Reportedly, one location of adulteration was investigated, though no prosecutions have occurred.

The artificial enhancement of chilli oils and sauces were identified following the similar events in Europe, where Sudan I was identified in chili oils originating from India. Identification of the adulteration has resulted in the recall and destruction of products. No illness or deaths were associated with the incident.

VA group of people was accused in counterfeiting alcoholic beverages in Konstantinovka, Ukraine. The businessmen mixed alcohol, water, and a variety of colorants to resemble the appearance and taste of cognac. The imitated cognac, which was produced in unsanitary conditions, was then labeled as a brand-name product and sold as a genuine product. The adulteration was disclosed as a result of police's investigation. In total, the police confiscated more than 2,000 liters of alcohol, 6,000 bottles, 6,500 fake labels, and other "accessories" necessary for the production of the counterfeit alcohol.

VIn Rovno, Ukraine, a man organized a large scale production of counterfeit alcohol. As a result of police investigation, 12,200 bottles of counterfeit vodka labeled with a variety of brand names, more than 800 liters of pure alcohol, and 190 pieces of counterfeit excise duty stamps were seized. Additional raids resulted in confiscation of 400 more bottles of counterfeit alcohol loaded to be shipped for sale, 594 boxes consisting vodka with brand names "Medoff" and "\u0425\u043b\u0435\u0431\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0434\u0430\u0440", 600 liters of liquid with a distinct alcohol smell, and variety of different brand labels and excise duty stamps. The case is currently under further investigation to establish a complete chain of illegal shipments of alcohol excise duty stamps and counterfeit sales channels. One of the potential drivers for this adulteration might be a tough economic situation in Ukraine which cause people to find alternative ways to earn money.

Also, the materials used to produce the fake powder including raw material, packaging material, and finished goods were seized for destruction.

VResearch conducted through Chapman University\u2019s Food Science Program documented pet food mislabeling. According to the study, only 31 out of 52 products were labeled correctly. The rest of the samples were potentially mislabeled and/or consisted of unspecified kinds of meat. Most commonly, the tested pet food samples were diluted with meat species such as beef, lamb, chicken, turkey, and pork or substituted with chicken and pork. Researchers report that the main concern associated with mislabeling pet products is that by consuming improper kinds of meat pets with allergies might be harmed.

VA two year investigation in Puerto Rico revealed that dairy farmers and truck drivers were allegedly adding water and salt to milk and selling it to consumers. Water was added to increase milk volume while salt was added to mask the dilution. On December 18th, 1998, 25 people associated with the adulteration were arrested. Officials indicated that the perpetrators were adding thousands of liters of water and salt to milk in order to maintain the milk quota and increase profits.

VSweetened condensed milk is product in high demand in Russia. 68 percent of the sweetened condensed milk samples checked by Russian food inspectors in Moscow as well as 22 percent of the samples checked in St. Petersburg were found to not meet Russian food quality standards (GOST) and sanitary norms (TU and SaNPin). The majority of the adulterated samples was determined to adulterated due to the presence of vegetable oils which are not allowed in the sweetened condensed milk that bears the GOST label. The GOST label is a widely recognized mark that is used by consumers to distinguish high quality products from others.

VThong Phat coffee producing enterprise, which is a warehouse located in Hiep Tan Ward, Vietnam, was inspected. The company that was selling tons of coffee to the market on daily basis was found producing no real coffee. Instead, soybeans were used as a base, roasted, soaked in chemicals, and then flavored with a fragrance. The final product did look and smell like coffee though there was no single coffee bean in it. The enterprise\u2019s owner, Le Minh Thong, said that his enterprise had produced fake coffee for two years; the processed volume was around 1.5 tons of fake coffee a day.

VJamaica\u2019s Blue Mountain coffee is one of the country\u2019s most valuable exports, fetching around $56 per pound when sold to the US and up to $72 in Japan, which imports over 80 percent of the island\u2019s crop. Though reputation of this valuable crop is carefully protected and Jamaica\u2019s Coffee Industry Board\u2019s Coffee Industry Regulation Act controls which producers are allowed to apply the globally-protected certification mark of Blue Mountain, coffee counterfeit and fraud are not uncommon. Thus, Brand Infringement and Enforcement Taskforce was conducting surprise raids. One of them, in a popular supermarket in uptown Kingston revealed that two coffee brands - Golden Spring Jam Foods and Hemp Coffee were selling counterfeit Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee. The adulteration was disclosed after it was discovered that neither Golden Spring Jam Foods nor Hemp Coffee were licensed by the Coffee Industry Board to be trading the authentic Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee.

VIn Georgia, counterfeit production of "Borjomi" mineral water was discovered in three different plants. About 4,650 bottles of the fake "Borjomi" which was ready to be sold on the market were seized from the plant. Moreover, 1,423 packs with the water bottles, many "Borjomi" labels, several 200-liters containers with the counterfeit water in them, and the equipment used for the production of adulterated water were seized. Officials indicate that besides "Borjomi" the plants were also producing counterfeit "Likani" mineral water. Despite the fact, that the counterfeit production took place in Borjomi district, Georgia, none of the accused plants was affiliated with neither IDS Borjomi Georgia nor IDS Borjomi International. Thus, the plants had no legal right to neither produce nor distribute the water under "Borjomi" or "Likani" label.

VIn the United States and Canada, orange juice produced by Home Juice, Everfresh Juice, and Holiday Juice companies was diluted with a sugar and water, as well as allegedly diluting the their orange juice products with a non-food-grade substance to enhance the shelf-life. Everfresh Juice was formed by the combination of several juice subsidiaries (Home Juice, Everfresh, and Holiday Juice companies) owned by the Labatt company in Canada. The alleged product was from a German company called Oleum320/IDEA or diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC). It is alleged that the German product was brought through customs labeled as a pesticide and was added to the orange juice products as a means to sterilizing the product to prevent spoilage and extending the shelf life. The adulteration was reported to FDA and government officials by former employees and a competitor whose sales were being undercut by the adulterated product. When examined by the FDA, no traces of DEPC were detected; however, the samples were tested several months after being taken and DEPC generally breaks down in a few weeks after exposure to air and within 24 hours of being added to a liquid. The derivative, urethane, was not tested. Officials from Labatt worked with the FDA and indicated that the president of Everfresh had worked with other employees to secretly adulterate the orange juice and concealed by using chemicals that couldn't be detected and created a fabricated set of books. Court documents also indicate natamycin may have been an additive. No illnesses or deaths were reported in association with this incident.

VQuality Egg LLC was pleaded guilty in mislabeling its egg products. The incident started back in 2006 when the company started practicing indication of the false expiration dates on the eggs. The products were sold despite their true age with the intent to earn revenues by misleading state regulators and retail egg customers. In addition to mislabeling the age of the egg products, the company was also involved in bribery of a public official in 2010. Quality Egg LLC's employees gave cash bribe to an Inspector of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to corruptly influence the inspector's authority to restrict sale of unqualified eggs (containing Salmonella Enteriditis). Though re-processing of such eggs is required by law and USDA standards, briberies let Quality Egg LLC sell eggs without any additional investments to ensure quality and safety of the product.

VIn Italy during December 2014, 8 people were arrested in connection with origin-masking of extra virgin olive oil. Companies in Apulia and Calabria created false documents claiming that their oil was "made it Italy" though the origins of the oil were unknown. 500,000 liters of oil was confiscated and was valued at 3 million euros. The suspects are being held with charges of agribusiness fraud and tax evasion. No illnesses or deaths were associated with this event.

VGyaneshwar Paunikar was accused of milk adulteration. He used pasteurized, homogenized and toned milk of brands like Amul, Dinshaw and Haldira. The actor and his associates were opening milk packages and replacing milk with water. The packets were then sealed again and sold to the market. A total of 39 liters of milk was seized. The adulteration was discovered from a tip received from a consumer activist Mohammad Shahid Sharif, who had been keeping a watch on Paunikar for some time and had informed the FDA about it.

VSeveral food products made by Casey\u2019s Seafood Inc., a Virginia based seafood producer, were found mislabeled and adulterated. Even though all the tested products were labeled as "Atlantic blue crab" and "Product of USA," the majority of them contained crab species indigenous to the western Pacific Ocean, near Indonesia. In particular, of eight packages purchased in September, 2014, only one came back as solely Atlantic blue crab. A similar check in December 2014 showed that out of six tested containers, five contained crabmeat foreign to Atlantic Ocean. Likely, the imports of foreign crabmeat, its repackaging and mislabeling allowed the dishonest producer to avoid competing on the same playing field as other watermen and earn additional profits from selling the cheaper kind of crab meat at premium prices.

V"Doktorskaya" is a very popular sausage product in Russia, which was formulated in USSR. To call a sausage "Doktorskaya" a producer should satisfy several strict requirements specified by GOST standards. Yet, in a recent check conducted by Roskontrol, which is a quality check agency, 10 out of 13 producers of sausage "Doktorskaya" were found to be adulterating their production. Thus, in several cases collagen protein was used to increase the apparent levels of protein. Soy-based products were also used to increase the apparent amount of protein and as stabilizers. Starch and various preservatives were also found in sausages labeled with GOST trademark, even though GOST prohibits these substances. In addition, high amount of phosphates, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were also found in couple samples even though they are banned according to GOST standards. Lastly, several producers simply did not indicate the correct amount of various substances in their products.

VResearchers from Department of Safety and Quality of Milk and Fish Products at the Max Rubner-Institute in Germany conducted a study in 2013 evaluating substitution of common sole (Solea solea) sold at retail. A total of 47 common sole dishes were ordered at 24 restaurants in four German cities; also, 98 samples were purchased at 35 different fish markets, supermarkets, specialty markets, home delivery services and wholesale dealers in the same cities. The investigation identified one instance of common sole substitution among the samples taken from the retail locations and 23 instances of substitution among the samples collected from restaurants. Though several cases of adulteration in restaurants may have happened due to lack of knowledge, the majority of adulterated samples were substituted with less expensive species.

VOut of 15 fast-food outlets in Derbyshire, five sold turkey instead of ham, while eight used a mix of cheese and a cheese substitute, which is made with vegetable fat instead of milk, instead of genuine milk based cheese. Though the adulterated products were used as ham-and-cheese pizza ingredients, none of the pizzas contained the appropriate label that would inform customers about substitution. Moreover, one of the suppliers explicitly claimed that the takeaway they was selling real cheese, even though the further tests revealed it was a mixture of cheese and cheese substitute. Likely, the adulteration allowed the perpetrators to earn additional profits due to the usage of cheaper ingredients.

VProtein powder made out of ground porcine and bovine gristle and bones was added to chicken to increase product weight as part of an incident that involved several Western European countries. Manufacturers in Germany and Spain developed protein powders that were injected into chickens in the Netherlands and then ultimately sold to wholesalers first in Ireland and then in the United Kingdom (UK). The heavier, adulterated product drew higher prices for companies along the supply chain. The bulking agent was so highly processed that it passed conventional DNA tests. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) in the UK discovered the incident by using a specialized DNA test following several years of complaints and allegations regarding the use of non-chicken protein powders.

VFrom 1995 to 1999, a wholesaler smuggled many tons of illegally-harvested caviar from sturgeon species into the U.S. The sturgeon species originated in the Caspian sea and were protected by an international conservation treaty. In some cases, the caviar were packaged in tins with fake Russian health agency certification seals and sold as Russian beluga caviar. The wholesaler also falsely represented American shovelnose sturgeon roe and paddlefish roe as imported sevruga caviar. The products were distributed to multiple grocery stores in the Maryland area.

Grinding the coffee beans with other products stretches the total amount of product to increase profits. The Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (ABIC) tests for impurities in the coffee, and repeatedly finds violations in large and small scale coffee processors.

The results were published in 2011. Eight percent of the samples were determined to be alternate species of fish, and - in total - 22% of the samples had genetic markers of fish that were not MSC-certified Chilean sea bass.

VDairy producers in China used chemicals left over from the leather softening process and added them to milk to boost the apparent protein content as measured by nitrogen determination tests. Increasing the apparent protein content can also mask the dilution of milk with water. One specific producer was named in 2011; however, reportedly this practice was occurring since 2005. The adulteration was identified during an on-site inspection of the producer, where bags of leather hydrolyzed protein were discovered.

VAn Ohio based company, Valdoliva, was labeling its olive oil as certified kosher when it had yet to be certified. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Kosher products have a unique, but large consumer base that relies on the certification to verify that they can consume the product. The fraud was discovered during a certification inspection when the inspector found already-labeled bottles containing the kosher certification mark even though the company was not certified at that time.

Extra virgin olive oil is a purer product and is much more expensive than virgin or refined oil. An investigation began when the Coordinator of Organizations of Farmers and Cattlemen (COAG) complained to local administration who sent samples to be tested in AgriFood Laboratories. Over eleven thousand liters were recalled by authorities.

VIn Australia, The Big Olive Company was cited for mislabeling their product, Oz Olio, as extra virgin olive oil when it was not extra virgin. No illnesses or deaths were reported. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission conducted testing that indicated a high level of free fatty acids in the oil. This indicated that the olives used to produce the oil were damaged or of inferior quality. The Big Olive Company was charged over $13,000 for its 1500 liters of mislabeled oil.

VShrimp contaminated with chloramphenicol was found on an Asian shrimp ship near Louisiana. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Chloramphenicol is an antibiotic used in shrimp to prevent disease outbreaks in overpopulated conditions. A Louisiana shrimper notified the agricultural commissioner who then inspected imported shrimp being sold at local grocery stores.

VAn Italian firm was accused of smuggling Chinese garlic through Bulgaria and then selling it in Italy. No illnesses or deaths were reported. At the time of shipment EU states could import garlic from Bulgaria without paying a tax, whereas if it was shipped from China tax was charged. The fraud was discovered when the percent of garlic imported into Italy from Bulgaria rose 30%, while imports from China dropped. At the same time imports from China increased in Bulgaria.

VThe FDA confiscated 1144 cases of frozen crab meat found to contain chloramphenicol in Louisiana. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Chloramphenicol is used as an antimicrobial to kill pathogens sometimes present in crab and other sea-creatures. It is banned in many countries, including the United States for its potential side effects. It is unknown how the adulteration was found.

VFollowing an inspection, the FDA sent a warning letter to the president of a company that produced crab and artichoke dip indicating that the product was adulterated and misbranded. The citations included multiple mislabeling violations: "no food coloring," "no additives," and "no sugar." However, the product contained added color, artificial flavors, sodium tripolyphosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and sugar. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Additionally, although labeled as "crab and artichoke" dip, the product contained imitation crabmeat.

VIn Spain, tests conducted at the request of UK FSA on 10 brands of saffron concluded that some "top-quality" saffron contains only 10-40% of actual saffron. The remaining derives from other parts of the crocus flower. Saffron is the most valuable spice on the market, therefore vulnerable to adulteration and high profits. The adulteration was detected by a British chef, who with his own money requested assessment of Saffron. With the results, United Kingdom Food Standards Agency was prompted to intervene.

VIn Hungary, in 1994, nearly 50 people were hospitalized and several deaths occurred from lead poisoning after consuming paprika that was adulterated with lead oxide. The lead oxide was used to enhance the red color and add weight. Paprika was banned from Hungarian stores after one-third of test samples were found to be adulterated. Authorities said the contaminated product came from private producers and not licensed paprika plants and was not exported. Charges were filed against 37 perpetrators who were reported to have mafia connections.

VHungarian and Slovenian authorities seized Hungarian labeled paprika after unauthorized levels of aflatoxins were discovered in The Red and Gold Strong Pista brand paprika. Aflatoxins are naturally occurring contaminants, but the climate and conditions of Hungary prevent the growth of Aflatoxins meaning the paprika was imported from elsewhere and blended with the Hungarian paprika. Hungarian producers bought paprika from abroad due to last year\u2019s small crop, and mixed it with their own product. European Union officials ordered products with that ingredient to be removed from store shelves and Hungary banned the sale of paprika until it was certifiably safe. No illnesses or deaths were reported in association with this incident because the product had not yet made it to market at the time of discovery.

VA milk factory in Ukraine, Belitski Milk Factory, CJSC, was accused of mislabeling its sweetened condensed milk. As it was discovered by the Antimonopoly Committee, the milk factory was selling condensed milk in cans illegally labeled with a special quality sign. This sign signifies that the product does not consist vegetable oils or any other artificial enhancers. Yet, tests revealed that the condensed milk produced by Belitski Milk Factory contained palm oil, which is not allowed in production labeled by the quality sign. Due to this reason, the milk factory was fined \u20b430,000 (about $3,750).

Chinese star anise, a tea spice, is often used to treat infant colic; however, it was found to be adulterated with with Japanese anise tea. Japanese star anise causes both neurologic and gastrointestinal toxicities. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against consuming teas brewed from star anise fruits.

VA study conducted by Herrero et al. (2012) identified that 30% of the commercially obtained sample of Common sole (Solea solea) were mislabeled. Thus, the researchers obtained 28 samples of whole fish products and 12 samples of frozen fish fillets from supermarkets and shops in Spain. All samples were labeled as Solea Solea, yet, only 28 samples were authentic. Thus, the study discovered that 10 whole fish products were not Common sole but rather Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis), Bastard sole (Microchirus azevia), and Sand sole (Pegusa lascaris). Moreover, two samples of the frozen fillets were made of Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and Sand sole (Pegusa lascaris) instead of Common Sole. Researchers suggest that Common sole is being replaced by related species due to its considerable commercial value.

VItalian researchers conducted a study that aimed to assess quality of fish products available on the market. A total of 58 seafood samples were collected during routine inspections of the trade locations. These samples included 40 samples of whole fish and 18 samples of commercial fish products. DNA sequencing techniques were used to characterize all the samples in study. It was determined that three out of 18 samples of commercial fish products were mislabeled. In particular, it was revealed that two samples that were labeled was frozen cod fillets in batter were in fact made of saithe (scientific name: Pollachius virens). Another sample labeled as grouper frozen fillets turned out to be greenland halibut (scientific name: Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Pollachius virens is a species with less economical value than cod and thus frequently used in transformed food products where substitution is impossible to detect by simple inspection. Also, grouper is a precious fish species and is often item of substitution and mislabeling fraud.

VDNA barcoding was applied to access quality of fish fillets labeled as tilapia, Nile perch, bas fish and tra fish. A total of 90 samples were purchased from local markets in three Egyptian governorates (Cairo, Monufia and Qalyubia) between September and November 2013. The analysis of the samples revealed that 50% of the 20 samples labeled as Nile perch were in fact made of tra fish. Similarly, 100% sample of the 20 samples bearing label "Basa" turned out to be made of tra fish, too. Thus, the study found that 33% of the tested samples were adulterated. Researchers do not disclose the names of the producers. Yet, they point out that the adulterations are likely triggered by economical motives. Thus, it is stated that Nile perch is sold at the higher market price than tra fish while bas fish have higher production costs than tra fish.

VA total of 69 tins containing adulterated oil was seized. Two men were arrested. Even though use of animal fat for preparing food products is prohibited by the Food and Safety Act, the adulterated oil was prepared from oil extracted from melted fat of buffalo, cow, and carcass, Although dangerous to health, oil made from carcass and animal fat is in huge demand especially by fast food vendors because it is significantly cheaper than genuine oil. For example, a 15 kg tin of oil made from animal fat could be bought for Rs 200, while one litre of edible oil used for cooking costs between Rs 80 to Rs 100.

VAt least 360 cans of counterfeit oil were seized from an oil godown near Bareilly, India. The perpetrators illegally labeled an edible oil product with several brandnames and sold it to the market at lower price than the genuine product. The case of adulteration was discovered after a tip off from an owner of an oil brand accusing some local businessmen of selling adulterated oil of his brand in the city and its adjoining areas at cheap rates. The samples of the oil were also submitted for quality testing.

VIn 2013, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences researchers collected 534 whole animal samples of various fish and seafood species from the Huanan market, Maidelong supermarket and several vegetable markets of Wuhan, Hubei. DNA testing revealed that 8 common economic aquatic products were mislabeled. In the case of finfish, the substitute species for Pampus argenteus, Scomberomorus commerson and Paramisgurnus dabryanus were Pampus punctatissimus, Scomberomorus niphonius and Misgurnus anguillicaudatus, and the substitution rates were 75%, 93% and 36%, respectively. Dasyatis bennetti, Chanodichthys mongolicus and Larimichthys crocea were 100% sold as Rajidae species, Cultrichthys erythropterus and Larimichthys poly. Crustaceans and mollusks species Portunus trituberculatus and Portunus pelagicus were sometimes switched, whereas Octopus vulgaris and O. vulgaris were often sold as sleeve-fish because of their extremely similar morphological features.

VOkara district authorities seized 7,000 liters milk adulterated with urea, formalin, detergent, ammonia and some other chemicals. The adulteration was discovered after the two vans, which were transporting milk, were stopped for a random milk quality check. After the case of adulteration was registered, the milk was disposed in the presence of the authorities and the vans were impounded.

VSpecial agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations, and officers with U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 660 barrels of honey shipped to Houston from Latvia between October 2014 and February 2015. The fact that Latvia, which is a small country by the Baltic Sea, does not produce much honey and actually imports the majority of its honey served as a clue that the true origin of the product might have been masked. Though the falsified documents indicated Latvia as the produced location, the honey, which was valued at $2.45 million, was imported from China. According to the law, Chinese honey is a subject to imposed anti-dumping duties. By labeling honey as a product of Latvia, the perpetrators aimed to escape the economical obligations.

VAn investigation revealed that 26 out of 49 ingredients used to produce the Similac Advance Organic Infant Formulas were not organic. For example, substances like sodium selenate,which is an extremely hazardous and toxic compound, and taurine, which is a synthetic additive that has been associated with negative brain and nervous system effects in animals, have been found in the Organic infant formula even though they are not organic at all. Literature suggests that the producer, Abbott Laboratories, Inc. and Abbott Nutrition made deceptive claims regarding the quality of the product while selling the product at premium prices. In addition to misleading its customers, the producer was also able to make higher sales and take away significant market share from competing products. The lawsuit against the fraudulent mislabeling of the product produced by Abbot was filed on May 15, 2015.

VA man was sentenced for meat mislabeling. As a result of inspection conducted by federal inspectors in Romans II meat processing company in Norfolk, NE, 300 pounds of sausages, 400 pounds of beef jerky, bacon and deer meat in bags labeled as ground pork were seized. The listed meat was labeled as ground pork. Moreover, the label bore the USDA mark of inspection which in fact was never grated by the authorities. To justify the act of adulteration, the man insisted that the meat was being help for special customers and thus there was not need to label it appropriately.

VIn this study, 143 prepacked beef and poultry products were purchased from several national and international supermarket chains in Malaysia. These samples were analysed for the presence of common meat species (buffalo, cattle, chicken, goat, sheep, duck and goose) and meats prohibited by Islamic laws (\u201cHaram\u201d) using species-specific primers. The results showed that 112 or 78.3% of samples were mislabelled, attributed by the false declaration of species and/or presence of undeclared meat species. Exact results show that 49/58 of beef products; 62/84 of chicken products; and 1/1 of duck products were mislabelled due to species substitution. The highest incidence of species substitution (\u226580%) was detected in beef sausages, meatballs and ground meats; while no incidence of species substitution in cooked whole muscle meats was noted. Overall, this economically motivated adulteration holds potential financial, health and conservation impacts on Malaysian communities.

Of the 52 products tested, 31 were labeled correctly, 20 were potentially mislabeled, and one contained a non-specific meat ingredient that could not be verified. Additionally, meat species that were not included on the product label were detected in 16 of the 20 potentially mislabeled products, with pork being the most common undeclared meat species detected. For example, a dry dog food product was found to contain undeclared ovine, turkey, and porcine ingredients in addition to the declared chicken and bovine ingredients.

VA total of 48 samples of various fresh and frozen meat kinds were collected by researchers for DNA analysis. The samples were purchased from 5 online specialty meat distributors and 4 retail outlets in Orange County, CA. The study revealed that 10 out of the 48 samples were mislabeled. Though some of the mislabeling might have occurred due to cross-contamination and mishandling, the researchers indicate that several samples labeled as black bear burgers, yak burgers, ground kangaroo, and ground bison were diluted with a lower economical value meat. For example, ground yak is sold for US $19.69/kg while ground beef is sold for ground beef US $9.14/kg. In the study, it was revealed that the product labeled as yak burger was actually made of beef, thus signifying economical motivation to the adulteration. In addition to dilution of products with a lower value meat, the researchers also found presence of horse meat in the samples label as ground bison and ground lamb meat. One should note that sale of horse meat in the USA is illegal.

In connection with this discovery, 22 suspects were arrested. Moreover, though not official yet, it is suspected that besides addition of the coloring agent to make the product more appealing to customers, perpetrators also use candle wax to make the product look thicker.

VTesting conducted by the DGCCRF, which is the department of Consumer Affairs and Fraud Control in France, between 2014 and 2015 revealed presence of undeclared meat in tested sausages, salami, and fresh butcher shop products. Out of the 644 samples subjected to the laboratory analysis, 26.5% were non-compliant with the standards imposed on the meat production. Undeclared or unauthorized use of meat substitutes, which poses an economical advantage for unscrupulous producers, was revealed in 19% of the instances: pork was discovered in 11% of samples, poultry in 5% of the samples, and horse meat in 3%. The horse meat was discovered to completely substitute declared donkey meat in one of the tested sausage samples.

In some cases, the non-lamb meat could not be identified. One study was performed by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and found 30%of the sampled meals contained other types of meat or no lamb at all. A separate study performed by a consumer group found that 40% of sampled meals contained other types of meat or no lamb at all. There is an economic incentive to adulterate lamb with less expensive meat. The adulteration was detected following investigations by the FSA and a consumer group, \u201cWhich?\u201d

VIn Kentucky, 9 people were arrested for allegedly stealing bourbon and selling it under false pretenses. Barrels and bottles of Wild Turkey, Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, and Pappy Van Winkle were stolen by employees involved in the syndicate. Wearing work uniforms, they sold to others for $1000-$1500, though many of the barrels were valued at $3000-$6000. Barrels of Eagle Rare are valued at $10,000-$12,000. The thefts were uncovered while one of the members was being investigated for illegal sale of steroids. No illnesses or deaths were reported in association with the theft and resale.

VA sea food fraud was uncovered in Iceland when trading standards officers visited a food store. It turned out that sea bass was substituted with Japanese sea bass, which is actually part of the perch species, and sold as a genuine see bass. For an economic gain, Michael Redhead misrepresented a statement made by the principal trading standards officer of Cumbria County Council saying that Japanese sea bass as well as Chinese sea bass were not permitted to be sold as a genuine see bass. Thus, Mr. Redhead misinformed his workers and suppliers and ran a tainted business of selling lower priced Japanese sea bass as a genuine see bass from 2012 until 2015, when the adulteration was uncovered.

The imported cheese was inspected by FDA and found to be contaminated with Salmonella, E. coli, alkaline phosphatase and Staphylococcus. Even though FDA ordered to destroy the contaminated cheese, several leaders of Mexican Cheese Producers Inc. of Darlington, WI in collaboration with Guadalupe Zurita decided to go around the order and distribute the cheese. Several fake documents were created and numerous attempts to sell the adulterated cheese were performed.

VPaul Begley was found to be the head of the garlic scam in Ireland that had been happening between September 2003 and October 2007. Considering that the price to buy Chinese garlic was low but the import duty on garlic could be up to 232%, Mr. Begley developed a scheme which allowed him to smuggle tonnes of Chinese garlic declared as apples. The scam was uncovered when customs officers at Dublin Port investigated a container that was thought to contain 18 tonnes of apples and two tonnes of garlic. In fact, the container consisted 21 tonnes of garlic with no apples inside. Investigators believe that more than 1,000 tonnes of garlic from China was illegally imported into Ireland by having them labelled as apples.

Though the agency did not reveal information about where the meat was produced or sold neither it provided the brand names, FSA declared that among the most widespread adulteration was dilution of minced steak and lamb burgers with undeclared pork; inclusion of undeclared beef into "pure" sliced lamb and black pudding; and sale of sheep meat as goat meet.

The adulteration was identified by another winemaker through tasting; he then reported possible adulteration to the authorities. Tests concluded the winemaker was using an alternate grape and investigations found records of nearly 600 tons of grape substitution dating back to 2003.

VOn May 28th, 2012, four milk vendors were arrested for selling adulterated milk. The police seized 181 adulterated milk packets and 161 liters of adulterated milk that had been diluted with sewage water. It is claimed that the arrested persons had been adulterating the milk for last six months. The perpetrators collected milk packets from garbage, filled them with 60% milk and 40% waste water and sold the packets. Another method used was to tear open branded milk packets, and mix dirty water in them before sealing them with a stapling machine; the packets were then sold to the general public.

VAfter a pesticide residue check at a farmers market in China, green peas with an unnatural color and odor were reported. The peas were traced to two illegal workshops. Dried peas were soaked in a green colorant and sodium metabisulfite to give them the appearance of fresh peas. Also, this process increases the weight of the peas which can now be sold at a higher price than the dried peas. This is not an isolated incident, it is lucrative and has been reported in 2005, 2006, and 2007 but previously little was done by the authorities.

VA group of eight people was arrested transporting diluted milk to a dairy cooperative company (Aavin) in India. The subsequent investigation of this case revealed that the adulteration was organized and was most likely going for at least 10 years. A man who was affiliated with a political party and owned the transportation company was determined to be the main organizer of this crime. Investigators suspected that changes in Aavin administration in 2008 as well as the changes in the Aavin transport department largely contributed to the crime potential.

VBeef in Mexico was found to be tainted with clenbuterol, a banned growth enhancer. In 2010, 297 individuals visited the emergency room after eating tainted meat. In 2007, 795 people were hospitalized following consumption of clenbuterol-tainted meat. Some ranchers in Mexico use clenbuterol because it bulks up beef cattle and thereby increases profits. Detection has been difficult both because clenbuterol produces leaner and pinker meat that is preferred by consumers and also because some ranchers reportedly sell beef to smaller slaughterhouses operated by municipalities where federal inspections may not routinely take place. Slaughterhouse inspections conducted by federal authorities continued to detect the presence of clenbuterol in cattle as recent as 2014.

VIn Dongri, India, four individual actors were arrested for milk adulteration. 400 litres of adulterated milk and more than 500 empty packets of branded companies were seized. The accused were diluting milk with water and then selling it in the market or distributing it door to door in the nearby buildings. Police reveals that the actors had been arrested for a similar offense in 2012. A similar case was disclosed at the same time in Dadar where four men were arrested for milk adulteration. They also were adding water to milk packets and then distributing them to the market. Police does not comment whether there is a connection between these two cases.

No illnesses or deaths were reported. The adulterants were found in an investigation by the European Commission.The contaminant is specific to olive pomace oil and is thought to be introduced during its additional chemical processing. PAHs are created under extremely high heat or burning conditions, likely poor processing technique.

At packaging and distribution facilities E141 (containing copper complexes of chlorophylls and chlorophyllins) was added to match the color of extra virgin olive oil. The oil was then sold to tourists on bus tours, small business, and wine cellars. An investigation by Spanish authorities was instigated after receiving multiple complaints of olive oil adulteration.

VIn Spain, sunflower, palm, and avocado oils were processed in an industrial plant and sold as extra virgin olive oil. No illnesses or deaths were reported. An estimated four million dollars of fraudulent oil was sold. The oil was processed to hide many of the markers used to verify the identity of the oil and then sold in bulk to businesses or as bottled labeled as olive oil. Nicknamed "Operation Lucerna," Spanish authorities investigated this incident for a year before arresting 19 people involved.

No illnesses or deaths were reported. Lampante oil imported into Israel has a lower tariff than edible oils which also sell for higher prices. The Israeli Agriculture Ministry's Flora and Fauna Supervision Unit and the Health Ministry confiscated 25 tons of oil after noting that the oil was less than half the price of comparable products.

No illnesses or deaths were reported.Olive pomace oil is produced from pressing the byproducts, the pits and pulp, with the help of chemical solvents and is sold for much less than higher quality olive oil. The adulteration was discovered by the North American Olive Oil Association when the advertised price was significantly less than 100% pure olive oil brands sell for.

VIn Australia, three distributors were found to be for selling oil that had been refined, possibly mixed with canola or rapeseed oil, or was of inferior quality. No Illnesses or deaths were reported. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission investigated claims of the adulterated extra virgin olive oil from consumers on the quality of the oil products. Two of the three distributors, Calcorp and Basfoods, have agreed to certification of compliance by a third-party for the next three years. The third distributor, IGA Distribution, will require its suppliers to notify them yearly of specified test results, verifying compliance. Following this incident, and a general increase in olive oil concerns, a third-party organization, Standards Australia, wrote an olive oil standards document which was recognized by the Australian government.

No illnesses or deaths were reported. The oil was imported from Malaysia and sold in 3 Liter tins. In 2013 the Australian Olive Association (AOA) examined the oil after hearing complaints from a consumer. The AOA then informed the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission who prosecuted and fined MOI International for almost $20,000.

VIn Italy, Spanish olive oil was confiscated in the southern town of Salerno after contradicting origin documents were discovered. When the oil truck was checked a fraudulent document of origin stating that the oil was from the Campania region of Italy was presented. The oil was on a truck from Spain, and a document in Spanish language translated to "Extra Virgin Olive Oil-100% Spanish" was uncovered. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Italian olive oil is in high demand and is tightly regulated.

One of the owners said the rice was added to make the flour appear whiter and of higher quality enabling the perpetrators to sell the flour for a higher price. After receiving consumer complaints, the mills were raided by the health department.

VFormaldehyde was found in noodlefish in Hong Kong at levels higher than naturally present. It is unknown if any illnesses or deaths occurred. Formaldehyde is used as a preservative and could have been added right after the fish were caught, during transportation, or storage. Formaldehyde is a clear liquid and is invisible, although it may cause fish to stiffen or smell. CFS, a unit of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department that serves the Special Administrative Region that governs Hong Kong, targeted formaldehyde in noodlefish in a recent targeted food surveillance exercise.

VTwo men illegally imported chinese honey worth more than $1.4 million, first shipping it to the Philippines and Thailand to hide its true country of origin. The anti-dumping duties owed on the honey total more than $3.3 million. Investigators determined there were no manufacturing facilities in Thailand and the Philippines where the honey was supposedly processed. In fact, one of the locations was actually a warehouse used for storage and repackaging of goods. Falsified documentation was also found.

VChinese catfish was shipped to Cambodia, labeled as product of Cambodia, and then shipped to the U.S. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Seafood imported from China is subject to large anti-dumping duties. The Cambodian importer was affiliated with a Chinese exporter, but that information was mislabeled at the time of the incident. The consequence was a 112% increase in anti-dumping fines for the the Chinese exporter by U.S. Commerce.

VFreeza Meats Ltd, an Irish company which was involved in a horse meat scandal in 2013, found guilty in another twelve offences against the Food Safety Order (NI) 1991 and the General Food Regulations (NI) 2004. The company was supplying to the market adulterated beef products. In these meat products the genuine ingredients were diluted with cheaper products, i.e. beef hearts; the cheaper ingredients were not declared as an ingredient on the label. Freeza Meats also admitted packaging Halal burgers that were not Halal. To decrease the production costs, the company used meat not slaughtered in Halal ways so they were able to save on hiring a Muslim preacher that had to be present during the Halal met preparation. To this date, the company was announced to be out of the market.

VSeveral men affiliated with Midamar Corporation were accused in changing the establishment number for PM Beef in Windom, MN, to the number assigned by USDA to the O\u2019Neill Packing Co. in Omaha. The act of halal beef mislabeling took place because O\u2019Neill Packing Co.'s establishment number was approved for export to Malaysia and Indonesia while the PM Beef's was not. Officials believe that the change of establishment numbers was a part of a scheme to falsify export documents and earn additional profits on halal meat exports.

VHorse meat was detected in a number of products labeled as beef across several European countries and elsewhere. Affected products included frozen meals, frozen lasagna, and frozen beef burgers. The product passed through complex supply chains that involved several countries, but the horse meat ultimately originated from suppliers in Poland and Romania. It is believed that the high price of beef created an incentive to adulterate products with less expensive meat such as horse meat. Experts believe the complexity of the supply chains combined with failures in auditing and regulation systems allowed the adulteration to take place. European meat traders also forged paperwork such as invoices, labels, and declarations to sell horse meat as beef. The incident was first detected by the Food Safety Authority in Ireland following tests of frozen beef burgers and frozen meals. There are conflicting reports regarding whether the tests were part of random surveillance or if the authority had been tipped off prior to testing.

VIn the United States, millions of cartons of "orange juice from concentrate" were sold that actually contained small amounts of diluted juice adulterated with beet sugar, citric acid, amino acids, orange pulpwash (the residual pulp remaining after oranges are squeezed, not permitted in pure orange juice), and an antibiotic preservative called natamycin, which was not approved by FDA for use in beverages at the time. The use of these products may be beneficial in extending the shelf life of the product at reduced cost. The concentrate was also supplied to school districts in Chicago, St. Louis, and Detroit as well as Ohio and Indiana. The company plead guilty to defrauding the public for $40 million. During a routine inspection, an investigator from the FDA saw an employee of Peninsular Products adding orange pulpwash to a juice labeled as orange juice from concentrate. No illnesses or deaths were reported.

VSun Up substituted an inexpensive liquid beet sugar for some of the more expensive orange juice concentrate, then labeled the product unsweetened orange juice concentrate and sold it to manufacturers for making juice for retail sale. FDA investigators found that up to 20 million pounds of beet sugar was used in the adulteration through a system of hidden pipes and rooms to evade detection upon multiple FDA inspections. The estimated cost to consumers was $10 to $20 million. Sun Up used other companies (Candy Base Co. and Frank Farmer) as "fronts" for buying sugar; these companies created fake billing documents for orange concentrate. FDA discovered the secret rooms after interviews with Sun up employees. No illnesses or deaths were reported in association with this adulteration.

VPhthalates (industrial plasticizers) such as DEHP (diethylhexyphtalate) were added to sports drinks, juices, tea drinks, fruit jams, jellies, and syrups in Taiwan; the adulteration was discovered In 2011, but may have been occurring for a number of years. More than 200 potentially adulterated products from 34 Taiwanese companies were exported to 22 countries. The phthalates served as clouding agents in the products, extended shelf life, and were cheaper than approved clouding agents such as palm oil. The adulteration was discovered by a team of scientists at the DOH and FDA.

VA company responsible for supplying school lunch programs across 10 US states added illegal amounts vegetable fillers and water to ground beef. The company received donated beef from the federal government for the National School Lunch Program, replaced a portion of the beef with the fillers and water, and then sold the remaining unadulterated beef to private customers. Two former federal meat inspectors were charged with fraud and bribery for their involvement. The incident was discovered after the company's ground beef subsidiary was sold to a group of investors. The investors contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation after finding discrepancies in company financial records and a large supply of filler.

VIn Kirov, Russia, 3 men were accused of illegally producing alcohol, counterfeiting it and then selling to public market. The illegal alcohol plant was based of a small cafeteria, facility of which was used to mask the illegal production. Branded alcoholic beverages like Red label, Blue Label, Chivas Regal were adulterated and then sold for 3 to 4 times cheaper than the normal retail price. The color and smell of the famous whiskey and cognac were resembled by addition of various flavorings and colors. The alcohol content was achieved by diluting pure alcohol with water. Officials suggest that most of the operations were done with no assigned proportions in unsanitary conditions so none of the produced beverages could be considered safe for human consumption. Besides counterfeiting whiskey and cognac brands, the perpetrators also counterfeited some Russian brands of vodka. Officials suggest that the legal producers of authentic alcohol brands lost up to $53,000 due to the widespread of counterfeit production. Moreover, the perpetrators gained as much as $70,000 in net profits.

The victims purchased their alcoholic beverages in Swarna Bar located in Krishna Lanka area in Vijayawada, India. Investigation determined that adulteration of the alcohol happened in the bar, not in the breweries where the alcohol was obtained. The bar employees pledged that they were adding some kind of white powdery chemical into the alcohol and labeling it with branded names.

VA study conducted on the milk quality on Tanzania revealed that milk dilution with water was the most abundant method of adulteration. Thus, milk vendors (MV) who sell milk in shops and street vendors (SV) were found to sell the most diluted milk which contained as much as 19-21% of water. Private farms and smallholder farms traded water-diluted milk though the dilution was 12.4% and 9.5% respectively. Researchers suggest that such dilution might have occurred due to unintentional mixing such as carelessness during cleaning of dairy utensils. Nevertheless, the milk vendors (MV and SV) who are the middlemen dealers between producers (farms and farmers) and consumers would benefit significantly from increasing the amount of milk by dilution git with water.

VAt the Cochin Port, India, 38 consignments of cassia, weighing a total of 6 kg, were illegally imported through the port. Cassia is a spice which is used to substitute in whole or in part cinnamon even though this can trigger many negative health reactions including jaundice, purging, kidney/liver damage and even cancer. It is illegal to sell Cassia in India, yet many unscrupulous traders do it due to the high profit margins. Thus, cassia is traded at approximately one fifth of price of the genuine cinnamon.

VEmployees at Rancho Feeding Corporation, a slaughterhouse in California, were charged with knowingly processing and distributing meat from diseased cattle. The incident resulted in a recall of over 8.7 million pounds of beef, including both whole carcasses and beef products. The recall affected stores in 45 states, Washington, DC., Guam and Puerto Rico. Stores affected include 7-11, Albertsons, Family Dollar, Kroger, Piggly-Wiggly, Walgreens, Target, Chevron, Food 4 Less, Rite Aide, Safeway, and Wal-mart. The meat was used in packaged foods including Nestle\u2019s Hot Pockets. The incident involved four employees who allegedly developed a scheme to bypass USDA inspectors. The slaughterhouse first purchased less expensive cattle that exhibited signs of eye disease. Many of these cattle were determined to be unfit for human consumption due to illness and were labeled as \u201cUSDA condemned\u201d by USDA inspectors. Employees involved in the scheme removed the \u201cUSDA condemned\u201d stamps from the cattle carcasses and moved forward with processing the cattle for sale and distribution. Another approach involved tampering with post-mortem inspections. Employees would place heads from healthy cows and place those next to the carcasses of unhealthy cows so that USDA inspectors were not aware that they were inspecting the carcass of a cow that did not pass an ante-mortem inspection. The incident was uncovered after the USDA determined that some products had not been properly inspected.

VIn January 2011, Cumbria County Council\u2019s Trading Standards team tested chicken tikka masala sold at two takeout establishments. The meals were identified as peanut free, but an analysis of the food indicated that peanuts were present. An investigation revealed that the two food establishments had been deceived, and a wholesaler (Euro Foods Ltd) was found guilty of supplying peanut powder instead of almond powder. The incentive for this adulteration may have been the price difference between peanuts and almonds.

VVarious brands of ghee like Vijaya, Kamadhenu and Jai Shree Krishna were adulterated by a young trader from Narayanguda, India. The man used palm oil and dalda to increase volume of the genuine ghee. The adulterated ghee was then repackaged to original one liter packs of Vijaya ghee, Kamadhenu ghee and Jai Shree Krishna ghee and sold on the market at a price that matched the original brands. The perpetrator managed to supply 500 liters of the adulterated ghee to the market and earned Rs 4,500 in net cash.

DNA analysis revealed that the samples of ground beef contained unreported pork, lamb, and chicken; the samples of ground pork were diluted with lamb, chicken, and beef. Testing of pork samples also detected the presence of horse DNA. Auchan representatives claimed that not all of the meat sold was produced and packaged by Auchan and indicated they were awaiting more details from Rosselkhoznadzor.

According to his report, the beef he bought was not overly cheaper than other beef sold on the market but was very salty and very tender compared to usual beef. Experts suggest that such substitution is done to earn higher profits.

VAlphin Brothers Inc., a North Carolina seafood processor and distributor, was accused in mislabeling farm-raised imported shrimp as a wild-caught product of the United States. The mislabelled product was then distributed in Louisiana. Besides mislabeling, the company was also accused in submitting false records in violation of the Lacey Act. According to court documents, an Alphin Brothers employee, who purchased and sold shrimp on the company\u2019s behalf, directed Alphin Brothers employees and employees of another seafood processing facility to falsely label approximately 25,000 pounds of farm-raised imported shrimp as wild-caught product of the United States. The adulteration was discovered in February 2015.

VAn investigation conducted by Dr. John H. Paul and his partner Dr. Bob Ulrich in restaurants across metro Atlanta revealed that more than one third of the grouper samples sold in the restaurants were a different species. Asian catfish was sold as grouper in multiple restaurants. Representatives from the restaurants denied responsibility and claimed that their suppliers could be responsible for the adulteration. Dr. Paul admitted that such scenario was very possible.

VIn China, Baijiu, which is an expensive grain liquor, was found to be adulterated with Sildenafil (a chemical commonly known by generic name Viagra). Police confiscated 5,357 bottles of the adulterated liquor, more than a ton of raw alcohol, and a lot of white powder labeled Sildenafil. The products were worth 700,000 yuan (almost $113,000). In addition to the Guikun Alcohol Plant and Deshun Alcohol Plant, about 50 other liquor companies across China were suspected in adding Sildenafil to their products. Though Sildenafil was banned as a food additive in China, companies often mislabeled adulterated products with health benefit claims.

VCounterfeit versions of brand-name vodka (including Smirnoff, Kommissar and Glens) were produced and sold in the U.K. In Derbyshire, 20,000 empty bottles, filling equipment, and empty cans of anti-freeze were discovered by Trading Standards officers at an illegal factory. 9,000 bottles of counterfeit Glen's vodka and manufacturing equipment were also seized at an industrial unit near Great Dalby, Leicestershire. Counterfeit bottles were seized from shops in Salford, London, and South Wales. Analysis showed that the fake vodka was diluted with industrial solvents and isopropanol.

The "starting materials" were ready to be packed and distributed on the market. The dye was added to the tea dust so that the final product would have a deep brown tinge when served for consumption. The house owner claimed that he was unaware that something illegal was being carried out in the portion of the house that he rented to the perpetrators.

VBrazilian beef was smuggled into China and sold to Chinese consumers during a ban on Brazilian beef imports. China banned beef imports from Brazil due to cases of Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in Brazil. Police identified eight \u201cbeef-trafficking rings\u201d that sold smuggled beef below the price of local beef which attracted many local buyers. The perpetrators sold locally produced beef at markets while hiding the smuggled beef in warehouses and only sold the smuggled beef through special orders. It is not clear if all end consumers were aware of the origin of the product. The adulteration was detected following a tip-off about beef from \u201cquestionable sources\u201d being sold a below market prices.

VIn Niger, a syndicate was caught in a palm oil adulteration scheme. The adulteration included a red coloring agent to dye the palm oil red, representing a higher quality palm oil, and mixing water to dilute the color and increase the amount. One of the suspects is also the deputy chairman of the Palm oil marketers Association in Niger. He said that he was aware of the adulteration but told them to stop. He could not say why he failed to report the adulteration to the authorities. A tip off brought the scheme to authorities attention. No Illnesses or deaths have been reported.

VIn Taiwan, Ting Hsin International Group was found to have used substandard oil to adulterate its lard cooking oil produced by child-company Cheng I. The oil was gutter oil and was destined for animal feed, but was purchased from Chuang Guann company. Chang Guann sold over 780 tonnes of oil to 1,200 restaurant, schools, and processors. Chang Guann is said to have obtained this gutter oil from an unlicensed factory in Pingtong County, who obtained it from an oil waste recycler. Additional substandard oil for animal feed was added to Cheng I products from Hsin Hao which obtained 424 tonnes of oil meant for animal consumption from 3 suppliers. The product containing the adulterated oil has been exported to Hong Kong and Macau. No illness or deaths have been reported.

VThe incident was discovered after a sample of "lamb" taken from a takeout restaurant was found to contain 28% beef. Further investigation of the incident led to a meat supplier who was selling diluted lamb. In June, 2014, testing conducted on the ground lamb supplied by the supplier in question revealed that only 20% of the sample was lamb while the remaining 80% was beef. Despite the warnings, the supplier continued to sell adulterated product which was confirmed by another round of testing in August 2015. Samples taken during the second round of testing contained 50% beef and 1% chicken. The supermarket was fined £20,000 for ignoring the warnings about the quality of the minced lamb and for selling the ground beef, which typically costs only half of the price of ground lamb, as genuine minced lamb.

VFox meat was added to donkey meat in China. The donkey meat was sold in Walmart chains across China and the meat was supplied by an unnamed meat supplier. It was not clear what incentive existed to adulterate the donkey meat with fox meat. The incident was detected after tests performed by the Shandong provincial Food and Drug Administration detected fox DNA in the product.

VThree lots of vitamin drink mix labeled as containing 20% cocoa were found to only contain 16%, two of the lots were diluted with ground cocoa husk and sucrose in the third lot. No illness or deaths were reported. These two adulterants are common substitutions for highly expensive cocoa powder. The producer of these products had been caught for the first time in 2011 substituting with sucrose and was subject to spontaneous inspection. The two lots containing the ground husk tested positive for a chemical component of the husk. This type of adulteration is more sophisticated and harder to detect.

VA meat processing company in Nebraska mislabeled hundreds of pounds of sausages, beef jerky, and deer meat products. The meat products in question were all labeled "ground pork" and also labeled as inspected by the USDA, but had not actually undergone USDA inspection. It is not clear if any mislabeled meat products were actually sold to consumers. The mislabeled meat was found during an inspection by the USDA and the incident was traced back to an individual employee.

VMax Moghaddam, owner of Bemka House of Caviar in Florida, smuggled restricted Paddlefish Roe to Belgium where it was relabeled as American caviar, a label specific to sturgeon roe, and sold. The paddlefish was restricted due to overfishing and habitat loss, similar to the world-wide sturgeon situation. The 'caviar' was sold for $230,000, at least $40,000 over its value. Moghaddam was caught and prosecuted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

VMiami based Viktor Tsimbal, also the president of Beluga Caviar Inc., smuggled more beluga caviar labeled as unrestricted Atlantic lumpfish in 1999 than the entire Russian export quota. The export of the beluga roe was restricted in 1998 with the CITES treaty, protecting endangered species. The caviar was first taken to Poland to mask its origin and declared as lumpfish to avoid both investigation and import fees. To get the caviar to the U.S. Tsimbal hired 'mules', people paid to bring a suitcase of caviar to the U.S. where they were given a hotel room for the night, $500, and sent back the next day. Tsimbal was caught and investigated by U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service's Division of Law Enforcement with assistance provided by the U.S. Customs Service and Food & Drug Administration. Tsimbal was also convicted of laundering the profits of his schemes.

VIllegal and expensive Russian beluga caviar was imported into the US in tins labeled as and topped off with cheaper osetra caviar. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Two men, Mr. Koczuk and Mr. Panchernikov, were the orchestrators of multiple smuggling campaigns, evading hundreds of thousands of dollars in import fees and permits. The beluga caviar is illegal because the sturgeon species that it comes from is endangered. The Fish and Wildlife Service was tipped off and conducted a long investigation.

No illnesses or death were reported. There was an anti dumping tariff in place against imported swai to deter other countries from selling at prices lower than the U.S. market. The fish all had false labels stating their identities. The case was investigated by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Washington field office.

VDoughnuts, cinnamon rolls, and cookies were mislabeled as low fat and sold to diet centers. No illnesses or deaths were reported. The sweets were found to be full fat with 18 grams of fat and 530 calories, (labeled as having 3 grams of fat and 135 calories), in addition to being glazed with chocolate instead of carob. There has traditionally been a high demand for low-calorie, low-fat foods in the U.S. Consumers reported the product after determining that the organoleptic qualities were too good to be true.

VBlack pepper in India was confiscated by the Food Safety Authority of Kerala because it contained mineral oil, burnt diesel oil, and possibly other toxic chemicals. The company that purchased the pepper (Kalimirch Vyapari Association) pressed charges against National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Ltd (NCDEX), the group who accredited the warehouses where the pepper was stored. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Mineral oil may be used on overly moist pepper to prevent fungus and mold, make the pepper heavier, darken the color, as well as to make the pepper shinier. NCDEX claims that they were unaware that the pepper contained mineral oil or other toxins. The pepper was confiscated after a complaint to the Food Safety Authority by a non-specified source.

VAn international trading company based in Germany, as well as subsidiaries in the U.S. and China, conspired to ship Chinese honey into the U.S. by declaring alternate countries-of-origin, in order to avoid paying antidumping duties. The honey was transshipped through countries including Russia, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand. Some of the honey was contaminated with unapproved antibiotics, and knowingly sold to U.S. customers. The fraud included the creation of "shell" companies, falsification of documents, and falsification of laboratory testing results. The fraud allegedly resulted in the avoidance of almost $80 million in antidumping duties.

VMango traders in India used calcium carbide to artificially ripen mangoes. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Calcium carbide was used instead of ethylene gas because it ripens fruit faster and maintains a consistent color without causing bruising. Perpetrators reportedly ripened fruit with calcium carbide crystals at night when they were less likely to be inspected. The Indian FDA did not indicate how the adulteration was discovered.

VShanghai Distributor of Netherlands based company, Hero, added expired milk powder and another non-specified milk source to Nutradefense infant formula, and repackaged it. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Nutradefense was marketed as being produced using exclusively Dutch milk, and was therefore sold as a premium product in China. Diluting it increased the amount of product that was available to sell. The perpetrator changed the production and expiration dates and then repackaged the formula to escape detection. China Central Television notified the public of the issue which instigated a recall and investigation by the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration.

VIndian restaurants in Scotland mislabeled beef and mixtures of beef and lamb simply as "lamb." The Scottish Food Enforcement Liaison Committee launched an investigation and determined that these incidents were difficult to detect because efforts were made to disguise the meat to resemble lamb and because some meat suppliers referred to products simply as "curry meat" rather than specific species. Scottish food authorities performed tests on samples of lamb curries from restaurants and discovered that only 64% of the "lamb" curries contained lamb meat alone.

VDuring the winter of 2013-2014, Oceana researchers conducted a study to identify the faulty of salmon sold on the market. A total of 82 samples were collected from grocery stores, smaller markets, and restaurants in Chicago, New York City, Washington, D.C. and several locations in Virginia. The samples were then identified using DNA analysis. The testing revealed that as much as 67% (27/41) of samples collected from restaurants were not the species identified by the labels. Also, 20% (8/41) of the samples from groceries and markets were also found to be adulterated with species not identified on the label. Most commonly, farm-raised salmon was represented as a wild-caught thus misleading consumers. In one case the fish labeled as "Wild Salmon" was actually identified as rainbow trout. In another case, Chinook (or King) Salmon, which is the most expensive kind of salmon, was substituted with Chum (or Keta) Salmon. Researchers suggest that such elevated rates of the species substitution and mislabeling might have occurred due to the fact that the study was conducted during winter, the time at which there is generally shortage of salmon supply.

VThe purpose of this study was to perform a market survey to identify species in game meats sold within the United States using DNA barcoding. They found that ten out of 54 commercial game meat products tested in the study were inaccurately mislabeled. One product was identified as a vulnerable species but was legally sold and four products were identified as near threatened species but were legally sold. The conclusion of the research suggests that over half of species substitutions may have been economically motivated.

VIn this study, the California Department of Food & Agriculture found that most imported olive oils tested failed to meet international standards. Of all the samples tested, 67% failed at least one measure of the new Olive Oil Commission of California (OOCC) standards. By contrast, only five samples (28%) failed one or more International Olive Council (IOC) quality measures. Only one of the samples (1269) failed a purity/adulteration measure (for stigmastadienes, which suggests contamination with refined oil) in addition to failing IOC and OOCC quality limits.

In addition, 1,000 empty boxes, 50,000 plastic packs and other equipment needed to print fake packages were confiscated. At the time of seizure, the fake Milo product was ready to be distributed to the market. Nestle, the official producer of Milo, launched a special program to educate its customers about key distinctions between authentic Milo and fake Milo.

VFour cases of counterfeit Smirnoff Red Label vodka were supplied to The Loft Weston-super-Mare, a night club in England. The fake alcohol was bought by the night club manager from an individual, whom the manager had known for couple years. After the manager realized that the alcohol was of law quality, he reported this incident to the authorities. The investigation found that the fake Smirnoff was diluted with isopropanol, which is a common ingredient in antifreeze and is dangerous for humans. Moreover, it was determined that the spirit was between 4.4 to 4.6 percent below the minimum strength of alcohol requirement for vodka. The perpetrator was arrested. He later admitted his guilt and said that he had to trade the fake alcohol due to financial unease, not due to malicious intent.

VIn this study, ten out of 48 ground meat products tested were mislabeled. A total of nine products contained additional species (usually lower-cost) not listed on the label. Interestingly, online specialty meat distributors had the highest rate of mislabeled products on the commercial market. Whereas, local supermarkets had the lowest rate of mislabeled products. Horsemeat, which is illegal to sell in the U.S. was detected in two of the samples acquired from online specialty meat distributors. Overall, the mislabelling detected in this study appears to be due to either intentional mixing of lower-cost meat species into higher cost products or unintentional mixing of meat species due to cross-contamination during processing.

VTwo class action suits: Koller et al v. Deoleo USA, Inc. and Med Foods, Inc. and Kumar et al v. Salov et al were filed during 2014 in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, against companies that represent a huge portion of the mass market of olive oil imported to the US from Italy. The claims in the two actions are fairly similar. First, was the issue of mislabeling - what was labeled "extra-virgin" actually contained refined oil and was therefore not entitled to the \u2018extra virgin\u2019 label. Secondly, the origin of the oil was only provided on the back label of the bottle while the prominent display of \u201cImported from Italy\u201d on the front misled consumers into believing that the olives originated in Italy. Thirdly, failure to package the oil in light-proof containers resulted in the decrease of quality. For example, if the oil was \u2018extra-virgin\u2019 at the time of bottling, it was no longer so when the consumer received it due to exposure to heat and light.

VRL Adams Pty Ltd is an Australian company which produces and sells chicken eggs. Recent investigations found that this company was illegally advertising its eggs as free range eggs, while in reality the laying hens were unable to and did not move freely on an open range. There was a large economical incentive to make the false claims because the free range eggs are traded at premium prices. The Australian producer was accused and ordered to pay $250,000 for its contravention.

VResearchers from Romania conducted a study a part of which was quality assessment of table wines traded on the Romanian market. For this purpose, the researchers bought 29 samples of sweet and medium sweet red wines bottled in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers. There were 17 samples of wine originated from Romania, three samples from Bulgaria, seven samples from Republic of Moldova, and two samples from European Union (EU). The acquired wines had 2011 and 2012 as the declared years of harvest. Testing based on measurement of stable isotopes content revealed that at least 8 samples of the collected wines were adulterated with sugar, high fructose corn syrup, synthetic red dye, and artificial sugars such as K acesulfame, saccharine, and aspartame. Moreover, another 5 samples were suspected to be diluted with water. The sugars and the dye were likely to be used to mask the dilution of wine with water.

VIn Italy, the official documents of multiple tankers filled with Turkish hazelnut and Argentinian sunflower oil were switched to Greek olive oil and delivered to the Riolio refinery owned by Domenico Ribatti. Ribatti\u2019s adulterated oil had gone to some of the largest producers of Italian olive oil including Nestle, Unilever, Bertolli, and Oleifici Fasanesi. These companies sold the adulterated oil to consumers as genuine olive oil. The economical advantages included direct profits and about twelve million dollars in E.U. subsidies intended to support the olive-oil industry. The companies that used Riolio's oil claimed that they had been swindled by Ribatti, and prosecutors were unable to prove complicity on their part. Despite numerous bribes that Ribatti had given to officials, the adulteration was uncovered due to investigation by the Guardia di Finanza.

VIn the United States, Investigators in FDA's Cincinnati district received a telephone tip claiming that Rubino USA routinely blended canola oil with pomace olive oil but did not declare the blend on labels. Reportedly, Rubino USA did not adulterate oils intended for retail packaging because the American Olive Oil Association randomly tested oils bottled for retail sale. The company also did not sell adulterated oils to a major grocery chain in the Cincinnati area because the chain had a product testing program that likely would have discovered the fraud. Rubino USA only produced the illegal blends to fill immediate orders for commercial users so no adulterated stocks would be stored at the company. The perpetrator plead guilty and was sentenced to four months in federal prison, four months of home incarceration, one year's probation, and $3,100 in fines for adulterating and misbranding olive oil. Officials found no evidence of health hazards with Rubino USA's adulterated products. The company defrauded consumers of about $280,000, according to FDA and court calculations.

VYuzhong Food Additive Company, which manufactured bleaching agents for flour mills, added pulverized lime to the bleaching agents and sold them to flour mills across China. Bleaching agents are usually made from cornstarch and shorten the time needed for flour whitening. By substituting the cheaper and heavier pulverized lime for cornstarch, they cut the cost of production for the bleaching agents, which were sold by weight. Competitors were suspicious because their prices were so much lower. The fraud was uncovered when whistle-blowers at the company informed authorities that they were instructed to add 500g of pulverized lime to every 2kg of bleaching agent.

VActing on a tip, Borivali police arrested 4 individuals that were involved in milk adulteration. By the time of the raid, the perpetrators managed to prepare 140 liters of diluted milk from 90 liters of genuine milk. It is not known how long the racket was operating, yet, police suggests that the perpetrators were earning nearly Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 on a daily basis. They also used polythene bags of several reputable brands and sold the adulterated milk in them.

The samples were tested at public health laboratories. The results showed that 317 milk samples (19%) failed to meet standard criteria while 89 milk samples were cited as unsafe for human consumption. 36 criminal cases were filed as a result of the adulteration detected. Adulterants included sugar, glucose, edible oils, milk powders and water.

VActing on a tip, Ahmedabad city police arrested three workers and their boss for producing and distributing adulterated ghee. The adulterated ghee was made from soya oil, vegetable oil, butter and turmeric while genuine ghee requires only butter in its recipe. A total of 200 kg of adulterated ghee, which was ready to be sold to the market, was seized along with 120 kg of the raw materials used in ghee production. Though the motives behind spurious ghee production were not indicated, it is likely that the upcoming Diwali celebration was among the incentives to produce ghee for cheaper price; it allowed higher profit margins.

VAccording to a study done by the KRO television program Keuringsdienst van Waarde, four out of 10 bought samples of lamb were not lamb at all. In fact, the four samples appeared to be turkey meat, which is much cheaper than ham. Economic profit that butchers can make by selling the substituted meat is the primary incentive for this adulteration.

VIn Ahmedabad, India, 3,870 kg of adulterated ghee were seized in December 2011. The ghee was prepared from soy oil and vegetable ghee with addition of edible colors and flavors. Then, it was packaged in tins, which were labeled with reputable brand names, and sold to the market. The production cost of one tin with 15 kg of the adulterated ghee in it was only Rs 900 while the market price the ghee was sold for was as much as Rs 2,000. Definitely, there was a big profit margin which was the incentive for the adulteration. Police officials, who were acting on a tip, arrested several individuals working in Shreeji Trading company and affiliated with the production of adulterated ghee.

VIn India, the Food Safety Department banned 9 coconut oil brands after they were found adulterated with palm oil, palm kernel oil, and mineral oils. Testing was based on iodine values, which were as high as 16.05, while the expected value is between 7.5 and 10. Officials suggested that price of coconut oil, which is \u20b9150 to \u20b9160 for genuine coconut oil, becomes a driver for adulteration when other oils sell for \u20b9120 to \u20b9130.

VNon-edible ghee, which was intended to be used for praying purposes, was sold in a milled package. The package was illegally labeled with the brand name "NaMo" and had image of a cow. Inspectors claim that because consumers don't usually read what is written on the back of the packages, the visual clues and recognizable brand name are the ways to distinguish between edible and non-edible ghee. Thus, there was a message on the box that it the ghee was not edible but there was no such warning on cartons of those ghee packets; this was misleading to customers.

VMillions of pounds of with high levels of mold or other defects were knowingly sold by a tomato processing company to multiple large food producers. The adulteration involved bribery at multiple large U.S. food companies and falsification of documents. Bribes prompted food buyers to purchase specific produce, sometimes at above market price, the additional cost was skimmed and split among the complicit parties. Multiple forms of mislabeling occurred by a food company, including mislabeling non-organic products as organic and misrepresentation of shelf-life labels.

VA meat supplier in China knowingly sold expired chicken and beef to fast food chains in China. The supplier reprocessed rotten meat and repackaged the product to reflect a new expiration date. The incident was reported by a news agency after undercover video footage was collected. The news agency began their investigation following reports from a former employee. The former quality-control officer sued the meat supplier for requiring him to falsify production dates on meat packages.

VSpecialty pork sausage sold in a United Kingdom convenience store was found to contain 46 percent horse meat. The Bulgarian sausage known as Lukana Chumerna was imported from meat producers in Bulgaria. It is believed that the ethnic food supplier that sold the sausage to the convenience store had not properly vetted the meat producer in Bulgaria. The incident was discovered after an informal test was performed on the product by a county trading standards council.

VOn May 30th, 2012, a woman was arrested for selling packets of milk mixed with sewage water. In total, police seized 92 adulterated milk packets and 81 liters of adulterated milk. It was reported that two methods for milk adulteration were employed. In the first method, branded milk packets were tear opened and a fraction of milk was replaced with dirty water; the packets then were resealed with a stapling machine and sent to the market. In the second method, empty milk bags were collected from garbage bins, filled with 60 percent milk and 40 percent dirty water, sealed with a burning candle and distributed to the market.

VAn Iowa beef producer, Midamar Corporation, was charged with selling non-Halal beef products labeled as Halal to consumers in Malaysia and Indonesia. The owner of Midamar Corporation also operated Islamic Services of America (ISA) to certify food products as Halal. ISA was one of only a few organizations approved by Malaysia and Indonesia to certify Halal beef imports. Midamar Corporation accepted orders for Halal beef from overseas consumers and then fulfilled these orders with beef products from a slaughter and production facility that was not certified by Malaysia and Indonesia for export. The USDA establishment number and labels from the original facility were removed and replaced with the Midamar Corporation USDA establishment number. False export certificates were also used. A former employee also testified that the producer substituted Kosher beef for Halal beef without involving Muslim experts in Halal slaughter practices. A USDA and Internal Revenue Service investigation led to the discovery of the incident.

VA fake goat cheese was discovered in British supermarkets by an independent consumer watchdog group Which? and food safety expert Professor Chris Elliott. Out of 76 tested samples of goats' cheese, 9 samples contained cheese from sheep milk. The investigation reveals that tree of the contaminated samples contained more than 8% sheep's cheese, another three samples consisted of more than 50% sheep's cheese, and the final three had around 5% sheep's cheese.

VBaltic salmon caught in Sweden was illegally exported to France, the Netherlands, and Denmark due to its high level of dioxins banned by the EU. Within Sweden it had to have a warning label stating consumption limits, but when exported these labels disappeared and the fish was sold in restaurants and grocery stores across Europe. No illnesses or deaths were reported. Salmon is plentiful in the Baltic sea, but Swedish consumption was low, leaving a large excess of fish to sell. A television series, Uppdrag granskning, alerted Sweden's national Food Agency and the European Commission of the incidents.

VA criminal gang in the province of Shandong, China used pure Rongalite (industrial bleaching agent) in tofu sticks to make them chewier and brighter. Rongalite is a banned substance in food production as it can lead to headaches, vomiting and cancer. The local Qilu Evening News newspaper stated the gang, led by three cousins, had bags of Rongalite powder stacked against the walls of the factory. Subsequently, the chemical was used to make dried tofu sticks, also called "fuzhu" which is a popular snack in China. Law enforcement seized nearly 10 metric tons of the toxic tofu. However, 100 tonnes had already been sold by the gang within Shandong and nearby Henan and Jiangxi provinces. Fortunately, there are no reported illness or deaths from eating the affected products.

VA Seattle-based fish broker intentionally substituted 136,000 pounds of turbot fish from China with much higher priced U.S. halibut. Turbot is an inexpensive fish often used to mimic higher priced fish prepared in deep fried dishes like fish and chips. Investigators claim that the fish broker brought the turbot from a wholesaler in Rhode Island then shipped it to a Washington State facility where it was labeled "halibut," then sent to customers in Utah and Texas. The adulteration scandal was exposed when a new manager at the processing facility in Washington state discovered the substitution.

VIn January 2012, a total of thirty-five eateries in China were found to be using illegal opium as a seasoning in their dishes. The eateries include a popular chain of hot pot restaurants in Beijing, which remains unnamed. According to the Chinese Food and Drug Administration, five restaurants are being prosecuted while 30 are still under investigation. The poppy derivatives identified in this incident included morphine and codeine which are banned as food additives in China. The motive behind using opium as seasoning is to "hook" customers on their food through the use of the narcotic which can cause serious addiction. This is not the first case of opium use in Chinese restaurants. For example, in 2014, a failed drug test led Shaanxi provincial police to uncover a noodle seller deliberately lacing meals with opium.

VOpium is a highly addictive narcotic drug derived from the opium poppy seed pod. When ingested over time opium, the brain becomes dependent on the drug\u2019s effects to function normally and withdrawal symptoms can occur such as nausea, sweating, cramps, vomiting, muscle soreness, depression and anxiety. Additionally, the longer a person consumes opium, the stronger drug craving (addiction) effects become.

VIn the UK, three deaths linked to peanut allergies triggered an investigation. Curry sauces in restaurants and takeaways were found to contain peanuts despite the claim of being peanut-free. Tests carried out by the Wigan Council found that the almond powder used as an ingredient in these sauces was diluted with up to 50% peanut powder. During 2013 - 2014, almond prices doubled, which may have increased the incentive for adulteration.

The results showed that the amount of methyl alcohol in both of them was above the allowed values (55.57 mg/100ml and 94.36 mg/100ml). In Venezuela the limit of methyl alcohol allowed wass 25 mg/100ml.

The results of the evaluation was that only five lots had a purity of 95%, one lot had 22% purity, and two lots did not contain any chia seeds.

VA food distribution company in Puerto Rico knowingly sold pork that was unfit for human consumption. The company, Joshua Enterprise, purchased over 50,000 pounds of pork shoulder from a transporter. Upon receipt of the pork shoulder, the transport company informed the food distribution company that pork had \u201csuffered temperature abuse\u201d during transport. Despite this knowledge, Joshua Enterprise went through with the purchase and ultimately sold or offered for sale the affected product. Approximately 42,000 pounds of the affected product were sold before the incident was discovered. The incident was discovered after USDA inspections determined that samples of the pork shoulders were not fit for human consumption.

VContaminated pork products and cooking oil from diseased animals were knowingly sold across 11 provinces in China. More than 100 people were arrested in a multi-year operation that involved the sale of pigs that died from diseases at very low prices to producers. The contaminated pork was processed into bacon, ham, and cooking oil. The perpetrators were able to get around the regulatory system by bribing food supervising authorities. Government livestock insurance agents were also bribed into notifying producers when insurance claims related to swine deaths were filed. Producers were then able to quickly purchase the contaminated pork from farmers at prices significantly below market values. It is not clear how the incident was detected.

More than 25,000 liters of the adulterated oil were seized. In addition,15,000 cans, 33,000 labels, 2,800 one-litre bottles of oil and 250kg of chlorophyll were also seized. According to Italy's La Repubblica website, cheap vegetable oil was purchased from the US and colorants added to bring its color closer to that of real olive oil. Seven olive oil factories were closed and about 39 people were arrested in connection to the food fraud. An investigation into the oil was initiated following customer complaints of poor-quality oil.

Co-contamination of melamine with cyanuric acid resulted in the formation of insoluble crystals in the kidneys of animals. Melamine was added to plant proteins to artificially increase the protein content of the products as reported by nitrogen determination methods.

VIn August 2001, 120 people became ill after consuming rat-poisoned noodles in Ningxiang, China (a city in Central China's Hunan Province). The poisoning incident was deliberate, it was an act of sabotage by a pair of Chinese men who are angry at the noodle factory owners. Patrons of 16 different restaurants reported severe diarrhoea and required immediate medical attention in the incident. Law enforcement said Yang Yufeng and Yang Zhiqiang (business owners) contracted their small noodle factory out to two brothers whose surname were Xie. The Xies argued with the Yangs because of a disagreement on contracts, and the two Xies left Ningxiang angrily.

VRat poison contains a variety of ingredients that work together to kill rodents; however, these substances are also lethal to humans if ingested. Therefore, it poses a serious public health problem. There are many symptoms associated with this type of poison, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In some cases, diarrhea may be blood-streaked. Abdominal cramping and indigestion are also possible. Additionally, some uncommon symptoms of rat poisoning include hair loss, fever, seizures, nerve damage, lethargy, restlessness, chills, dementia and nasal complications. Serious complications of rat poisoning are seizures, respiratory distress, trouble breathing, heart attack, internal bleeding, liver failure, and shock.

VDue to significant increase of prices of Arhar on Indian market, unscrupulous traders are mixing it with the cheap and low-quality Khesari pulse. The aim is to make the Arhar dal more available for average consumers, yet there is a great potential public health impact behind the adulteration. Thus, Khesari dal contains di-amino-propionic acid which could lead to paralysis of the lower body; it could also cause numbness in the limbs and spine. Due to this fact, Khesari dal was banned by the government in 1961. Nevertheless, large profit margin that perpetrators gain form dilution of Arhar dal increases the likelihood of adulteration. To put it in perspective, many people cannot afford pure Arhar dal which is sold for Rs 230/kg so they go to its cheaper versions that are the mix of Arhar dal and Khesari sold at Rs 90 to Rs 100/kg. Such great difference is allowed due to the low price of Khesari dal which is traded at Rs 40- 50 a kg and is very similar in terms of its appearance to Arhar dal.

VAs much as 3,420 liters of strawberries were stolen from a farm in Vinslöv, southern Sweden. The perpetrators were planning to re-sell the stolen at the Midsummer festival during which the sweet berries typically take centre stage. One should also notice that in 2015 Sweden experienced large shortages of local strawberries due to cold weather in spring so that the prices for the locally grown strawberries were held on a higher end.

VActing on a tip-off, officials uncovered a factory in Adavi Nekkalam, India, where large quantity of adulterated ghee was allegedly manufactured. The perpetrators were transporting stocks of ghee to other districts such as Odisha, Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam where the ghee was then sold under branded names. Police suggests that brands such as \u2018Sai Durga\u2019, \u2018Sri Durga\u2019 and \u2018Maa Durga\u2019 were used to market production. Besides this particular manufacture, several other factories were also raided and closed due to illegal production of spurious ghee.

It was suspected that the perpetrator(s) bought large containers of regular Heinz Ketchup and poured it into bottles labeled "Simply Heinz," a higher-priced product made with cane sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup. There was no indication that the counterfeit product had been sold at retail.

VExporters of Tanzanian rice were accused of dilution of genuine Tanzanian rice, which is usually sold in the higher price segment, with cheap Pakistani rice, which was illegally imported to Tanzania. The dishonest traders were mixing the cheap Pakistani rice with local rice and exporting it to Rwanda, Uganda, and the neighboring countries. As a result of such scam, the Tanzanian rice prices were pushed down affecting exports to East African Community member countries as well as local farmers.

VA Tanzanian businessman and his 50 employees were arrested after the rice scam was discovered. The perpetrators used sub-standard rice to dilute high quality rice and packaged it under a brand name "Arroz Mariana." The adulterated 25 kg packages of rice where then sold at full price. Moreover, some of the packages were underweight; several consisted of as little as 21 kg of rice. The rice scam was discovered after Ayan Trading, a genuine producer of Arroz Marianna rice complained about the fraud. The police pretended to be a customer and ordered 30 tones of rice from the perpetrators. The order's total cost was $12,500. The police officer, who went to pick up the order, discovered the perpetrators packing the diluted rice into the branded packages.

VThree plasticizers were reportedly detected in samples of Chinese liquor: diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP), and dibutyl phthalate (DBP). They were reportedly added to approve the appearance and taste of the high-end liquor product. The adulteration was detected when a reporter who received a tip purchased 4 bottles of the liquor and sent them to a third-party company for testing. The company did not initiate a recall, and disputed the findings.

Besides the fact that the adulterated oil was sold at nearly five times the original price, the oil was also found to contain lamp oil which is unfit for human consumption

VActing on a tip, police arrested two milk suppliers that had been allegedly adulterating milk of brands such as Amul, Gokul, Annapurna and Mother Dairy. Though there is no test results available yet, the officials believe that the milk was diluted with water to increase its volume and then repackaged into brand name packages. At the site there were around 100 packets of milk from brands such as Amul Gold, Amul Taza, Gokul, Annapurna, Mother Dairy. All packages and the instruments used to adulterate the milk were seized.

A truck driver described as about 6 feet, 2 inches tall, weighing about 198 pounds, and speaking with a very distinctive Russian accent is believed to be the perpetrator. Though not employed by the delivery company, the man managed to have all the correct numbers for the walnuts shipments.

VSchuler Grain Co. added urea to their wheat to increase the amount of nitrogen present in the wheat. Wheat was priced based in part on protein content, and buyers measured the protein content using a method that measured nitrogen as a proxy for protein content. Higher-protein wheat generally commanded a higher price. By increasing the presence of nitrogen, the wheat appeared as though it had more protein. FDA was prompted by a tip to inspect the company and discovered the use of urea. During FDA's investigation in 1985, evidence was found that suggested the the company also sold adulterated wheat in 1981 and 1975.

VA least 600 people in India reported food sickness after consuming adulterated kuttu flour (buckwheat flour) during the holiday "Navratras". Kuttu flour is better known as buckwheat flour, a staple ingredient in many traditional holiday foods. It is not uncommon in India for manufacturers to stretch supplies of flours by adding unapproved additives and using expired products for additional sale during holiday times. The Indian Food and Adulteration Department tested samples of the products and found 18 of 72 to be adulterated.

VThe Food Standards Authority (FSA) of Britain found that between 25% and 75% of the rice was not basmati. Basmati rice is considered more expensive and higher quality than most other varieties of rice. By substituting basmati rice with other varieties such as putna, sharbati, and other non-basmati rices, companies were able to earn greater profits. Basmati rice dilution and its subsequent mislabeling is a long-lasting lasting case of unfair trade practices. The labeling standards in terms of what can be labeled as basmati rice and what cannot were reinvestigated.

VAt least 1.7 million liters of Chinese honey were imported to Australia, repackaged without any other processing, re-labeled as Australian and exported to the US, Canada, and European countries. Presumably, the adulteration was motivated by the inexpensive prices of honey produced in China and the anti-dumping duties imposed on imports of Chinese honey. Australia also detected problems with royal jelly that was labeled as Australian but did not originate from Australia.

VItalian officials confiscated 2,500 tons of non-organic fruit, grains, and soy for being mislabeled as organic. The mislabeling occurred during a period of four years involving 700,000 tons of food. Organic certifications were forged so that the products may be sold as organic making the products more valuable to the consumers. The investigations began after one company grew from a profit of 1.5 million euros to 60 million euros over the course of a few years.

VTwo meat suppliers in Taiwan sold lamb products that were adulterated with pork, beef, lamb oil, or a water-retaining agent. The adulterated meat was then distributed to over 100 restaurants and market vendors. The first company, Ching Lung Meat Company, simply mixed lamb with pork. The second company, Hua Yuan International, manufactured three \u201cgrades\u201d of lamb. The first two grades mixed lamb with pork jowl and minced beef, respectively. The third grade was pork that had been adulterated with lamb oil and contained no actual lamb meat. Hua Yuan also added a water-retaining agent to frozen meat to increase product weight. As lamb is more expensive than pork, the companies adulterated the products to increase profits. It is not clear how the adulteration was initially detected, but an investigation of the two companies was launched after market vendors were investigated and lab tests revealed that the lamb products contained pork.

As a result of investigation, police seized 160,000 litres of falsified Brunello di Montalcino and Rosso di Montalcino wines, which are among the most famous and expansive wines, and 2,350 fake labels. Low quality local wine was substituted for genuine wine and put into bottles with fake labels. If the fake wine were sold, perpetrators would have earned up to 5.0 million euros ($6.45 million). Yet, as officials report, no fake wine was supplied to the market.

These beans, which were imported from Taiwan, were found to contain Dimethyl yellow, a non-permitted colouring matter in food. In Hong Kong, dimethyl yellow is not permitted in food. The maximum penalty for selling food containing added non-permitted colouring matter is a fine of $50,000 and six months' imprisonment. Investigation is still ongoing to determine who is responsible for the food fraud.

Another standardized type of rice noodles is mixed rice vermicelli which should contain of more than 50 percent rice than can be mixed with flour or other edible starches; crude protein level should be at least 2.5 percent.

VIn 2013, as many as 150 German and 36 Dutch poultry farms were investigated for fraud involving organic and free range eggs. Investigators indicated that over a number of years German poultry farmers systematically violated rules for the production of organic and free range eggs. Moreover, it was suspected that perpetrators used double book-keeping systems and fake invoices. Standards required a minimum of 4 square meters per animal on poultry farms to use "free range" and/or "organic" labels on eggs. By increasing the number of hens without expanding the amount of land, producers where able to increase supplies of eggs. By violating organic and free range standards for eggs, perpetrators were able to sell eggs at about 10 cents more per egg vs. conventionally-produced eggs.

VNon-permitted coloring matter Sudan IV was used in duck feeds to enhance the colour of egg yolks. It is believed that red yolk in duck eggs indicates better quality and nutritious value of the product. Thus, eggs with red yolks are generally sold at a higher price. To enhance yolk color, producers were adding a special "red drug." The tests revealed that Sudan IV made up 46.5 percent of the contents of the "red drug" and marketed duck eggs consisted of as much as 0.137 mg Sudan IV per kilogram of eggs. After the adulteration was discovered, officials seized 1,159 kilograms of red-yolk eggs, all produced in Hebei Province.

VEvery year, about 800,000 tons of Wuchang Rice are produced while up to 10 million tons are sold on the market. Thus, as investigation on the quality of Wuchang Rice was conducted. It was found that some producers replaced most of Wuchang Rice, which is recognized as a local brand since 2009 and sold at a considerably higher price than ordinary rice, with cheap kinds of ordinary rice. Artificial flavoring was used to replicate distinct smell of Wuchang Rice. As a result of the investigation, 58.6 tonnes of rice from 16 companies were seized, including 3.4 tonnes of fake Wuchang rice that was a blend of cheap rice and higher-priced quality rice.

Investigators suggest that sweets and sweet products are in high demand before and at the time of festival, so consumers should pay attention to their food selections. Though no official laboratory results are available yet, preliminary tests showed that the plastic crystals went undetectable when sugar was dissolved in tea and milk. However, if test is conducted in cold water, the crystals do not dissolve and settle at the surface of the container.

VA cold storage warehouse in Northern Ireland repackaged and re-labeled animal-by-product intended for pet food as meat for human consumption. An investigation of the facility uncovered the animal-by-product as well as an industrial shrink-wrapping machine, labeling equipment, and forged veterinary records claiming to originate from various meat plants across the European Union. Meat sold for human consumption is worth significantly more than meat sold for pet food. The incident was first discovered when a shipping company reported a suspicious container arriving from Asia. A major criminal investigation of the incident was never launched, so details about specific adulterated products and distributed locations were not available.

VNon-organic pork was mislabeled as organic pork and sold to customers at Wal-Mart stores in the city of Chongqing in southwestern China. The organic pork was sold at higher prices than non-organic pork. It is unclear how the mislabeling was detected, but reports indicate that authorities warned the retailer about plans to fine Wal-Mart if actions were not taken. When the mislabeling did not stop, significant fines were imposed.

VA store in China adulterated chicken blood with dyes and printing agents and sold it to consumers as duck blood. The adulterants were added so that the product would be more appealing. Duck blood is a delicacy in China that is significantly more expensive than chicken blood. The significant price difference between chicken blood and duck blood created an incentive for adulteration. It is not clear how the adulteration was detected other than it was reported in the Chinese media.

VMore than 200 people were hospitalized after drinking tainted home-brewed liquor in western India; eighty six people are dead. Officials say that deaths from drinking illegally brewed cheap alcohol are common in India, where few people can afford licensed liquor. In Gujarat, where the incident happened, the problem with alcohol poisoning is even worse because the law prohibits sale of any alcoholic beverages. So, the beverages are manufactured illegally and then sold to people (who are mostly poor). In the present case, 32 suspected perpetrators were arrested. The investigators are not clear about the type of toxic chemical added to the moonshine.

VAfter many deaths and number of serious illnesses due to consumption of contaminated bootleg liquor were reported in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, police has raided 12,500 sites and seized 76,000 liters of substandard alcohol; 2,900 suspects were arrested. Illegal production of alcohol is widespread in India. Cheap alcohol usually fermented from molasses or mahua, a type of flower, and spiked with additives like ammonium chloride, lye, or even battery acid to increase strength or speed fermentation. To increase the alcohol content and potency, some people add sedatives, urea, oxytocin, or methyl alcohol.
