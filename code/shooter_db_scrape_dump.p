S"By of theA 33-year-old Milwaukee man is facing charges in the fatal shooting of Robert J. That total does not include two killings that authorities ruled were self-defense, nor the negligent homicide of Brown. John E. Nash was charged Saturday with homicide by negligent handling of a dangerous weapon. Police officials say because Brown's death was ruled negligent, it will not be included in the city's homicide total reported to the federal government, which follows the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting guidelines. Brown, 44, was shot about 7:15 p.m. Feb. 13 in the 3000 block of W. Wisconsin Ave., according to Milwaukee police."

Garrison was booked with attempted second-degree murder of Levier but he has not been formally charged by prosecutors. Levier was being held Thursday evening at the parish jail in Gretna in lieu of a $1.5 million bond. The court issued an arrest warrant for Smith, who had been released Dec. 30 on a $50,000 bond. Romalis Levier, 18, also was charged with attempted second-degree murder of the 16-year-old who authorities say first fired at him, triggering a Dec. 22 shoot-out at an Apache Drive apartment building.'

Two little girls, two-year old Lillyanna Valent and six-year old Nevaeh Oliva, were killed in the shooting. Court documents from the 347th District Court cite a lack of evidence as the reason charges are being dismissed."

But the Panama City Police Department is still investigating, along with the Bay County Sheriff's Office, which runs the jail. Police initially said the incident didn't warrant criminal charges because law enforcement officers are exempt from a state law barring guns on school grounds.

S'ALAMO HEIGHTS, Texas - An arrest warrant has been issued for a second suspect in the shooting death of a teenager in Alamo Heights. Police said Compean was attending a party in the 6800 block of Broadway when he left to do a drug deal that went bad. Police said they believe Spivey and Teneyuque tried to rob Compean before he was shot. "The media has been quite cruel in portraying (Compean) to be a drug dealer or involved in a drug deal, and that wasn\'t the case. Alvarado said she disagrees with the police account that the shooting stemmed from a drug deal.'

S'Murder charge stands against Detroit dad whose son killed self with unsecured shotgunDETROIT, MI -- The father of 9-year-old Daylen Head, who was killed with a shotgun at his father\'s home in Detroit Nov. 9, pressed his eyes into tissues during his preliminary examination Tuesday. The shotgun in Head\'s closet, which he said was left there by his landlord and last handled by him a week prior to Daylen\'s death, had a 15.75-inch barrel. The gun discharged, struck Daylen in the head and killed him almost immediately. "At the point Mr. Head placed a sawed-off, loaded shotgun in a closet, unlocked, accessible to children. He threw the shotgun into the closet, ran downstairs, said, "he\'s gone, call the police, call 911.'

S'LAS VEGAS (AP) - Authorities in Las Vegas are blaming a drug deal gone awry for the shooting death of a 17-year-old and the arrests of two men on murder, conspiracy and robbery charges. Police say witnesses identified McGee and Gisendaner, who allegedly took cocaine and the assault rifle from Soley. McGee and Gisendaner are jailed without bail. Kenneth McGee and Brandon Gisendaner are due to have lawyers assigned to their case Tuesday following their arrests last week in the April 24 slaying of Benjamin Andre Soley at apartment complex east of downtown. Court records say police found one bullet casing from an assault rifle and nine .40-caliber handgun bullet casings near a pickup truck where Soley was shot and killed early at the complex off Mountain Vista Street and Vegas Valley Drive.'

S"(AP) - Newton County authorities say a deer hunter died after accidentally shooting himself in the chest. The county sheriff's office says in a news release that 42-year-old Aaron Villines of the Kingston area was killed in the shooting Thursday near Elkhorn Church in western Newton County. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed. The release says Villines and another hunter were walking to check on a deer that one of them had shot when Villines apparently slipped on a moss covered rock and fell onto his loaded rifle, which then discharged and shot him in the chest. Villines was pronounced dead at the scene."

The victim, a man in his 40s, had been shot in the head, police said. The complex was the site of another fatal shooting in July 2013 when a 19-year-old woman was killed just feet from where the latest victim was found. A neighbor called 911 around 5:45 a.m. to report that a man had been found shot in the parking lot of the apartments at the corner of Gevers and East Houston streets. "As of late Tuesday afternoon, it was unclear what relationship, if any, the victim and Cisneros shared.'

Inside the car, the deputy saw a man later identified as John Anthony Musso slumped in the front seat of the car with drug paraphernalia in plain view, detectives said. It began about 2:13 a.m. Friday when a K9 deputy saw a black car stopped in the parking lot of a strip shopping center along the 4200 block of West Hallandale Beach Boulevard in West Park. A third deputy fired a shot at the car, but Musso continued backing up until he saw more patrol cars arriving.

Police said several other teens were at the home when the incident happened but the victim was the only one playing Russian roulette. Rider said fatalities involving Russian roulette are not common in Pueblo but said, "We don\'t want this to become a trend, either.

S'(Photo: Megan McCormick/USA TODAY NETWORK - Wisconsin )WISCONSIN RAPIDS - Police have confirmed the names of the dead in an apparent double murder-suicide in Wisconsin Rapids on Wednesday. Police began the investigation into the apparent double homicide-suicide Wednesday at 440 11th St. S., Wisconsin Rapids. Preliminary autopsy results show each of the three family members died of a single gunshot wound, Wisconsin Rapids Police Lt. Brian Krzykowski said. Justin Bohn, 36, appears to have shot and killed his daughter Paige Bohn, 5, and son, Devon Bohn, 3, and then turned the gun on himself, according to police. All three victims suffered fatal gunshot wounds prior to the arrival of police, Krzykowski said.'

S'Two men are facing reckless conduct charges in an accidental shooting earlier this month at Farmer\'s Best Market in Northlake. Because of this, officials reassessed the shooting and on March 21 decided to charge Hernandez, 36, of Northlake with one count of reckless conduct and Lulias, 64, of Addison with two counts of reckless conduct. As previously reported by Pioneer Press, Hernandez said he saw a firearm sitting on a desk that belongs to another store manager, John Lulias, who is also a licensed security guard. Hernandez said Monday he had apologized to the employee who was shot and thought the accident was behind him before learning of the charges. "Although this looks like an accident, two small children were nearly hit by the bullet," Nissen said.'

S'OAKLAND -- Two suspected gang members have been charged with murder in the shooting death of an 8-year-old girl killed while answering the front door during a sleepover in July, authorities said Tuesday. Nuno, Connors, Roos and Wilson were arrested Saturday after police served search warrants in Berkeley, Oakland and Hayward. Williams and Carroll were each charged with murder, three counts of attempted murder and shooting at an inhabited dwelling. Prosecutors will decide whether to seek the death penalty against Williams, who was embarking on a brutal crime spree when he killed the girl, investigators said. Williams was shooting dice with Medearis and others when he decided to rob Medearis, according to court papers.'

S'Two more suspects have been arrested in the slaying of a 14-year-old Peoria boy who was brutally murdered during a home invasion earlier this month. Both were charged with murder and home invasion - the same charge facing four other suspects who had previously been arrested. Investigators say it does not appear that the group chose the location at random, according to the Peoria Journal, but at this point as to why they chose the home has not been released. Lacy, 21; Alex F. Collins, 21; and Samuel T. Clay Jr., 20 - were sought and arrested earlier and have appeared in court. Kenny said there were so many bullets fired that investigators "lost track of the number of shell casings," the newspaper reported.'

For non-emergency information about where to find help and resources, there is Parent to Parent of Georgia: 800-229-2038.

S'Mesa County prosecutors Friday filed felony charges against a man who authorities say fatally shot a 14-year-old boy this month while hunting on national forest land in western Colorado. Authorities say Pohto was a licensed hunter. Justin Burns, of Palisade, died Sept. 13 of a gunshot wound to his chest at Big Creek Reservoir in the Uncompahgre National Forest, the county coroner\xe2\x80\x99s office said. Recreational shooting on national forest land in Colorado has come under intense scrutiny since the July slaying of Glenn Martin, 60, who was shot by an apparently errant bullet in the Pike National Forest. Guy Pohto, 59, faces allegations of reckless manslaughter and carelessly hunting wildlife, said Dan Rubinstein, a county prosecutor.'

S"No charges will be filed after a 5-year-old northwest Missouri boy playing with a handgun accidentally shot and killed his 9-month-old brother. The St. Joseph News-Press reports that Nodaway County Prosecutor Robert Rice said Friday that the mother and grandfather of Corbin Wiederholt weren't criminally negligent. A Missouri baby was killed Monday after his older brother got his hands on a gun and fired, hitting the boy in his playpen. But Rice said Corbin's mother and grandfather believed the firearms were locked up in a gun safe and weren't loaded. Rice said the 5-year-old found a .22-caliber handgun in the headboard of the grandfather's bed."

Prior to Thursday, police would not release the victim's name or say whether the shooting death was a homicide, suicide or accident. The day after the shooting death, police charged Jonmere A. Pryor with tampering with a physical evidence, carrying a firearm without a license and felony possession with intent to deliver illegal drugs. Police said Pryor and Bender were friends and were together in Pryor's basement apartment when the shooting occurred. Further complicating things, police allege Pryor tampered with evidence at the scene, which made it harder to corroborate any of the versions."

S"MANHATTAN \xe2\x80\x93 An intoxicated Manhattan man held a small child Wednesday in his home with a loaded gun, according to Manhattan Police Department Chief Joseph Wazny. The Manhattan Emergency Management Agency and special operations with the Will County Sheriff's Office also responded. Police officers responded at 6:15 p.m. to a townhouse in the 400 block of Fairview Drive in Manhattan for the reported domestic disturbance. Manhattan police convinced Kozlowski, 39, to release the child, according to Wazny, but Kozlowski then barricaded himself in the townhouse, refusing arrest and locking the door while holding a gun. When they arrived, the officers found a woman trying to leave the home with three children, one of whom Jason Kozlowski was holding in the upper level of the residence with a loaded weapon, Wazny said."

S"3-year-old dies after shooting self with grandfather's gunA 3-year-old boy who apparently shot himself with his grandfather's gun in Spring has died, authorities said. The boy's death follows a series of child shootings this year in Harris County, three of which happened over the course of four days in February and March. It was unclear Sunday where the gun had been stored or whether it had a lock. The boy, whose name Harris County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Tebben Lewis said was not being released, had been taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital Sunday in unknown condition. He died on Monday."

Defense attorney Eugene Tinari called the April 5 death of Jamara Stevens an "unspeakable tragedy. Tinari told the Philadelphia Daily News that he believes prosecutors will see that the shooting "was an accident and not a criminal act" on the part of his client. Thirty-one-year-old Tiffany Goldwire turned herself in early Thursday afternoon at the city police headquarters to face an involuntary manslaughter charge. " Police said the child was shot by a 2-year-old and died shortly afterward at a hospital.'

Pooler Police are investigating after two men in their early 20s were injured in a shooting at the Carlyle at Godley Station Apartments in Pooler.

The couple's daughter, Gabrielle Thurman, found out the cause of death when she went to pick up her mom's death certificate and found the medical examiner had declared the shooting was unintentional. Both Brenda and her husband Dwayne had extensive experience with firearms as they had both served in the Army as military police officers, yet the medical examiner found that Brenda's death was the result of an accidental discharge.

S'The shotgun in Head\'s closet, which he said was left there by his landlord and last handled by him a week prior to Daylen\'s death, had a 15.75-inch barrel. DETROIT, MI -- Christopher Head, a 45-year-old Detroit father, didn\'t pull the trigger; he wasn\'t even in the room. "At the point Mr. Head placed a sawed-off, loaded shotgun in a closet, unlocked, accessible to children. Not only was Head -- because of his felony record -- not legally allowed to possess a gun, but the gun the gun itself was illegal, the judge said at his preliminary examination. The gun discharged, struck Daylen in the head and killed him almost immediately.'

S'A young boy is dead, a family is grieving and nobody wins in a situation like this. Leaving these children home alone, with loaded weapons that were not properly secured, contributed to this young boy losing his life\xe2\x80\x9d. Additionally, there was an incident two years ago where the same boy accidentally discharged the same gun that ultimately killed him. The boyfriend of the mother of the 8-year-old boy named Clayton James Singleton, who killed himself with a gun on Oct. 10, will be charged with one felony count of child abuse, neglect or endangerment. However, at the end of the day, there are laws that I am obligated to uphold,\xe2\x80\x9d said District Attorney Steve Wolfson.'

Investigators believe the gun went off when his 11-year-old brother tried to get the gun to put it away.

An Oregon City police spokesman said Monday he would not yet reveal what caused deadly force to be used because of the ongoing investigation. A Taser was used to help subdue Moore, but it didn't stop him from resisting arrest, according to the agency. Both officers are on paid administrative leave while an investigation into the shooting is conducted. Moore's brother told The Oregonian/OregonLive that his younger sibling struggled with schizophrenia and wasn't prone to violence."

S'Columbia police arrested a 19-year-old man Thursday night after he fired a gunshot when an officer tried to pull over his moped. Police said at the scene that Dawson had fired at the officer, but a news release Friday morning said it was not clear whether Dawson fired at the officer or the gun went off accidentally. Dawson, a felon, was arrested on suspicion of armed criminal action, unlawful possession of a weapon, resisting arrest and unlawful use of a weapon. About 40 officers from the Columbia Police Department and other agencies responded to Quail Drive after the fleeing suspect, later identified as Vincent G. Dawson, fired a single shot when the officer tried to make a traffic stop. Dawson fled into a residence in the 2400 block of Quail Drive, where he was arrested without injury or further gunfire, Columbia Police Department spokeswoman Bryana Larimer said.'

Coroner Parks Evans tells local media that 53-year-old Reginald Darnell Dogan died Wednesday of the neck wound he received on May 2. Greenville County Sheriff Steve Loftis says his deputies were called to respond to a gun-waving man in the Greenville suburb of Taylors. Dogan was black and the deputies are white. He says a deputy ordered Dogan to drop the gun but he pointed it at officers instead; one officer held his fire to avoid hitting bystanders, while another with a clear shot hit Dogan in the neck.'

Walker then went to another bedroom and fatally shot Hale, 31, and her mother, Viola Warren, before committing suicide in his parked car at JFK Airport.

Shane Nichols was the seven-year-old \xe2\x80\x9cbug man,\xe2\x80\x9d or as his mother sometimes called him, the \xe2\x80\x9ccritter bug.\xe2\x80\x9d He kept jars of insects, from beetles to lightning bugs, in his bedroom.
