VALLEJO (CBS SF) – Police in Vallejo are investigating a shooting that left four people hospitalized on Wednesday night, a police lieutenant said.  Officers responded to reports of shots fired in the 1800 block of Mini Drive at about 10 p.m., Lt. Lee Horton said.  Moments later, residents of nearby Betty Court called 911 after victims of the shooting knocked on their doors seeking help, Horton said.  When officers arrived, they determined that four people — three men and one woman — had been injured by the gunfire, the lieutenant said.  Three of the victims were transported to John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek and another to NorthBay Medical Center in Fairfield to be treated for injuries, Horton said.  All four victims were expected to survive, he said.  Police found between 20 and 30 shell casings of multiple calibers on the street, and there was bullet damage to nearby cars and homes, Horton said.  The victims, who were all inside a white car at the time of the shooting, told investigators the shots were fired from inside a dark-colored car, according to Horton. After the shooting, the victims’ car crashed into a parked car, he said.  Horton said it is unknown exactly how the incident happened, but said the victims were the targets of the attack.  Police were looking into whether the shots came from anywhere other than the dark-colored car, and whether the shooting was gang-related, Horton said.  The suspects fled the area in the car and remain at large, he said. Suspect descriptions were not immediately available.  The investigation into the shooting was ongoing.  Anyone with information was asked to call Vallejo police at (800) 488-9383 or anonymously at (707) 644-7867.  (Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service. All rights reserved.
