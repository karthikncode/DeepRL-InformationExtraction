(Published Saturday, April 27, 2013)  A teenage boy is dead and three other people are injured after a drive-by shooting in Chester.  Witnesses say a Burgundy four door vehicle pulled up next to a group standing at Rose and Upland Street around 5:45 p.m. on Saturday. Several men inside the vehicle pointed weapons out of the window and opened fire, unloading more than 20 rounds, before fleeing the scene.  "I just heard, 'bom, bom, bom,'" said Luz Nieves. "I thought it was fireworks."  Police say Darren Burton, 17, was shot in the head. He was taken to the Crozer-Chester Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Burton's cousin, 16-year-old Jay Latham, was shot in both legs. An 18-year-old man was shot in the right leg and a 40-year-old man was shot in the chest. Witnesses say the 40-year-old was walking to a nearby store during the shooting and was likely an innocent bystander. Police say Latham is in stable condition, the 18-year-old is in serious but stable condition and the 40-year-old is critical but stable.  One witness, who did not want to be identified, says she's fed up with the violence in the area.  "If you're sitting in your living room you have to worry that a bullet will come through the window and strike you in the back of your head," she said.
