EAST PALO ALTO (CBS SF) — Five people were shot and a young girl was injured in East Palo Alto Sunday after gunshots were fired into a crowd of people at a bus stop near a McDonald’s restaurant, according to fire officials.  The incident was reported around 2:45 p.m. at a bus stop in front of the McDonald’s at 2401 University Avenue, according to Menlo Park Fire Department Chief Harold Shapelhouman. Police said a pair of shooters opened fire on the crowd, but there was no indication yet as to why.  Firefighters arriving on the scene found the victims – four inside the restaurant and two outside, but it is unclear where they were shot, Schapelhouman said. It’s believed the victims ran inside the restaurant for help.  Police were still sorting out the details late Sunday, but Capt. John Cook of the East Palo Alto Police Department did describe the scene to reporters:  “Approximately at 2:46 this afternoon, the shot spotter was activated, plus we had several calls from citizens about gunshots in the area at University and Bay, right by the bus stop and McDonald’s. There were four Hispanic young males there at the time, a grandmother, and a young granddaughter, approximately, 6-years-old. So five people were injured by gunshots, not life-threatening. The little girl was injured, but that was because she fell when she tried to run away,” he said.  Evidence markers were strewn across the street of the scene, likely marking expended shell casings from the gunfire. Police are also questioning witnesses who may have seen what happened.  Early reports indicated at least one victim, a man in his 20s, suffered serious injuries.  Most of the gunshot wounds were to the lower extremities, Schapelhouman said.  All the victims were taken to Stanford Medical Center for treatment.  (Copyright 2013 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service. All rights reserved.
