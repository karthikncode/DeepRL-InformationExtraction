Four people were wounded when gunfire erupted Wednesday night in the Elmwood section of Southwest Philadelphia, police said.  One of the victims was a woman who suffered a graze wound to her head while she was in a second-floor bedroom one block from where the shooting occurred, said Chief Inspector Scott Small.  About 9:20 p.m., one or more gunmen fired at least 28 shots in the area of Daggett Street and Dicks Avenue, Small said.
