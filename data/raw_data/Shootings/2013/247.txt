ST. LOUIS • Davonta Coleman fired multiple gunshots into a group of people Monday night, hitting four teenagers and two adults, prosecutors say.  Coleman, 21, of the 4800 block of Margaretta Avenue, now faces multiple charges of first-degree assault, armed criminal action and discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle.  Coleman got out of a car about 10:15 p.m. Monday and started shooting at several people standing in front of a home in the 4700 block of Highland Avenue in the city's Kingsway East neighborhood, police say.  Six people were hit by gunfire but all are expected to survive. They were among more than a dozen people shot and or stabbed during a violent Monday night and Tuesday morning in St. Louis.  Several of the victims in the Highland Avenue shooting are related to each other. They are a 34-year-old woman who was shot in her thigh as she held her 4-year-old daughter; a 22-year-old woman shot in the foot; a 17-year-old male; a girl, 15; a boy, 14; and a boy, 13. Police believe the attack was retaliation for an earlier fight involving the juveniles.  Coleman was jailed Wednesday in lieu of a $200,000 bail.
