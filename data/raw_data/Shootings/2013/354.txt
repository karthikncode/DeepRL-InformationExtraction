By Syma Chowdhry, Andrew Kramer, Kelly Hessedal    HAMILTON TWP., N.J. (CBS) – Officials say one person is dead and four others were injured after a shooting at a birthday party at a Hamilton Township, New Jersey home late Friday night.  The shooting happened around 11:30 p.m. on the 1100 block of Deutz Avenue.  According to authorities, about 100 people were in the living room of the home celebrating a 15-year-old’s birthday party when gun shots were fired.  “We saw them taking one of the kids away on a stretcher, then we saw another stretcher going in, and then they were taking somebody else out on a stretcher,” said neighbor Mary Pearsall.  Authorities say 17-year-old Shakir Williams was shot multiple times and pronounced dead on the scene.  “It’s heartbreaking because at the end of the day, the parents have to bury their 17-year-old child,” said neighbor Fortuna Jordan.  “My heart goes out to them because their child just came to a party to have a good time, and now isn’t going to go home,” said Pearsall.  Four other males, between the ages of 16-18 were also injured. One of them was shot multiple times and spent five hours in surgery and is now listed in critical but stable condition. Two of the victims were shot in the leg and the other victim was shot in the calf. They were taken to nearby hospitals for treatment and released.  There are currently no suspects and no motive for the shooting.  Police are investigating the incident.
