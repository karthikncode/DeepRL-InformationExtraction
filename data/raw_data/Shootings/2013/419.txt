Investigators are trying to track down the gunmen behind a quadruple shooting on the city's east side.  Kansas City police identified the victim as 19-tear-old Marcus Lyman.    Police were called about 2:15 a.m. Sunday to East 24th Street and Park Avenue on a reported shooting.  When officers arrived, they found Lyman and another male victim suffering from apparent gunshot wounds. Both were transported to an area hospital. Lyman was pronounced dead at the hospital.  Two other shooting victims were transported to the hospital by a private vehicle. Their conditions are unknown at this time.  Police said Lyman was the 64th homicide victim of the year.  His family spent Tuesday night out searching for justice at the National Night Out event in Kansas City.  "You think about a 19-year-old young man full of life, full of hope, full of promise and here we have these young babies around here in the community tonight. This is an opportunity for Kansas City to stand up and say we are sick and tired of being sick and tired and to stand up and say we are not going to accept violence in our community," Lyman's uncle, Marvin Lyman, said.  He said his nephew was fixing up a house his mom was going to sell when he heard a fight break out and went outside to see what was happening. That was when he was shot and killed.
