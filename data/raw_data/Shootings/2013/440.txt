OAKLAND -- Four people were shot on the 1700 block of Telegraph Avenue on Saturday afternoon, marking the second shooting involving multiple victims in the city in the past 24 hours.  One of the victims, a man, is listed in critical condition at an area hospital. The other three victims are listed in noncritical condition, according to Sgt. Jeff Thomason of the Oakland Police Department, and all are expected to survive.  Officers responded to the area around 4:08 p.m. and blocked off Telegraph Avenue between 16th and 18th streets. Details regarding what happened were scarce and no suspect information was available. The Uptown area is home to many popular restaurants and hangouts, including the famous Fox Theater and bar Make Westing.  It marked the second shooting involving numerous victims in the past 24 hours in Oakland.  Just after 11 p.m. Friday, two people, one of whom was a 38-year-old Oakland man, were shot dead and a third was critically injured after someone opened fire at a birthday party at a home in the 400 block of 105th Avenue in the Sobrante Park neighborhood.  Police were trying to determine Saturday if a fourth man who showed up later at a hospital with gunshot wounds was also a victim from the party.  Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland are offering as much as $25,000 in reward money for information leading to the arrest of suspects in that incident.
