BALTIMORE (WJZ) — The investigation continues into who shot seven people in West Baltimore, killing a 15-year-old boy.  Rochelle Ritchie has emotional reaction from neighbors.  That 15-year-old who was shot and killed would have been going to school Monday. But instead, his family is planning to bury him.  Baltimore City streets are filled with gunfire as police investigate another shooting. This one–injuring six and killing another– happened Saturday night in the 1500-block of W. Fayette Street.  “I think to hear seven people shot in a cluster is outrageous for this city. And it’s unacceptable for us as a whole,” said Commissioner Anthony Batts, Baltimore City Police.  Deshaun Jones–just 15 years-old and set to start at Frederick Douglass High School this week — was shot and killed.  “I seen him laying there fighting for his life,” a woman said.  Balloons and a stuffed animal are now left to show condolences for the life lost. Those living across the street are still overwhelmed with emotion.  Police believe the shooting started over an illegal game of dice.  “He was a young child. Nobody’s life deserves to be taken,” a woman said.  There are no confirmed reports that Jones was part of the game, or the intended target.  “Some of the other six victims, non-fatal victims, have had police histories. They have come in contact with us at different times. We know at least one of the victims has been shot prior,” Batts said.  The violence that has triggered across West Baltimore has residents sick to their stomachs. They’re begging the criminals to put the guns down.  Shootings in Baltimore have seen a frightening increase into the double digits. The extra police officers on the streets are not enough to bring comfort to those in the middle of a war zone.  “Everybody just needs to get together. Police, everybody,” a woman said.  Just this week, Baltimore City Police added an extra 150 officers to the streets.  No arrests have been made in the shooting.
