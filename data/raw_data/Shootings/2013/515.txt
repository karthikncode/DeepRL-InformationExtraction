Mead.  Seven people were shot, leaving one person dead, and the suspect still on the run.  Home to a cluster of bars and restaurants, Wichita’s Old Town became part of a crime scene Sunday morning.  “We have a total of seven people that were shot,” said Sgt. Scott Brunow, Wichita Police Department.  Police taped off the 100 block of N. Mead to investigate the overnight shooting that left a 25-year-old man dead and six others with gunshot wounds.  “Around 2 o’clock I was walking home from the bars and I heard commotion,” said Bryan Butler, Old Town resident. “I just thought it was typical drinking activities, but never thought anything of it.”  Investigators say the shooting happened right when Old Town bars were getting ready to close.  Officers directed a crowd of people when they heard at least 10 rounds of gunshots.  “Three victims were shot and they ran to Rock Island where they contacted officers,” said Sgt. Bob Gulliver, Wichita Police Department. “They were transported to the hospital.”  Officers rushed over to N. Mead to find three more victims at the scene.  “Several were transported by private vehicles to hospitals, three on scene,” said Sgt. Brunow. “A seventh victim did show up at an area hospital this morning that had been shot as well.”  Police identified the seven victims as all males between the ages of 25 to 35 years old.  25-year-old male, pronounced dead at the hospital 26-year-old male, listed in serious condition 28-year-old male, listed in fair condition 25-year-old male, listed in fair condition 27-year-old male, treated and released from hospital (age and condition unknown) (age and condition unknown)  It’s still unclear whether the men and suspects knew one another or what led up to the incident.  “I’ve been told to stay away from certain areas, but this is really the first time that I’ve experienced that kind of situation,” said Butler.  The entertainment district has seen it’s fair share of violent crimes in the past couple of years, prompting police to beef up their presence and patrol in Old Town.  “I’ve been down here eight years now essentially doing the same thing and it’s been fairly effective,” said Sgt. Gulliver. “I don’t think there’s anything different that we could have done.”  Police did talk to several witnesses at the scene, but they have not released any details on the suspect or a motive.  At this time they’re looking into the possibility that this may have been gang related.  Anyone with information is asked to call 911.
