MIAMI GARDENS (CBS4) – As Saturday night got underway, Miami Gardens police swarmed a residential neighborhood off of NW 187 Street and 30 Avenue. They cut access in and out for several blocks in that area after a gunman opened fire on four men, ages 19-23.  Neighbors stood around watching police gather leads, including shell casings and interviewing people.  Police said an unknown man walked up to a home where the four victims were sitting on a porch, started shooting, then ran off.  The victims were airlifted to local hospitals, two of them in serious condition.  One woman who lives a block away from the shooting told CBS 4 News she is frustrated and frightened because gun violence is increasing in the city she’s lived in for 20 years.  The woman chose to remain unnamed out of concerns for her safety. She said, “My other neighbors were saying they were afraid to even walk out. So, I’m considering moving somewhere, selling the house and moving.”  “As a police department, we’re very concerned that these individuals that are walking our streets are just simply walking up into these neighborhoods and opening fire,” said Detective Michael Wright, spokesman for the Miami Gardens Police Department.  The anonymous neighbor, who is the mother of a 14 year old boy, said, “I’m afraid for him. I won’t even let him go to the park. And he’s upset about that. But, I value his life and I want him around for a very, very long time.”  Police urge anyone with information to call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.
