Victim of early morning shooting identified Posted: Saturday, November 2, 2013 7:25 AM EDT Updated: Tuesday, December 17, 2013 11:56 AM EST  RADCLIFF, KY (WAVE) - One person is dead and three others are being treated for injuries after a shooting in Radcliff.  Police have identified Darren Johnson, 47, as the victim.  The shooting occurred just before 3 a.m. Saturday on Shelby Avenue at a private club.  Radcliff officers removed a vehicle and spent Saturday on the scene collecting evidence after witnesses took off when shots were fired inside 355 Shelby Avenue.  "Just as soon as they arrived, there were several people fleeing the scene. Numerous cars stacked up down Shelby Avenue," Public Information Officer Bryce Shumate said.  Two people were wounded when Radcliff police pulled up. Another person showed up on their own to Hardin Memorial Hospital with a gunshot wound.  "It is unknown at this time, since this case is all still under investigation, whether that shooting is related to the shootings on Shelby Avenue or whether the victim who went to Hardin Memorial came from a different shooting altogether," Shumate said.  Radcliff Police do not have any persons of interest in the case and are asking for the public's help.  If you have information that may help police track down the shooter, call (270) 351-TIPS to leave an anonymous tip or call the police department's main number at (270) 351-4477.
