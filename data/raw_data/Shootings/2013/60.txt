Authorities were asking for the public’s help in identifying suspects involved in the shooting and wounding of four men outside a Lancaster concert venue early Saturday.  The incident occurred about 2 a.m. after an altercation among patrons of Industry Theater in the 43000 block of Business Center Parkway spilled into the parking lot and gunfire erupted, according to Lt. Vince Carter of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.  “Four innocent patrons not involved in the altercation were hit,” Carter said. The victims -- age 22, 26, 29 and 37 -- were taken to a local hospital where they remain in “stable condition,” he said. They were not identified.  The suspects remain at large, authorities said, and no further details were available, authorities said.
