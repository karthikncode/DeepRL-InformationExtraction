PHOENIX - Police have identified a 19-year-old woman who was shot and killed late Saturday night at a south Phoenix party.  According to Phoenix police Sgt. Trent Crump, 19-year-old Nora Osman was shot at the house party near Southern and 53rd avenues around 11 p.m.  She was transported to St. Joseph's Hospital in critical condition and was later pronounced dead, Crump said.  The other three victims were an 18-year-old woman, 22-year-old man and 21-year-old man.  They were all self-transported to a hospital, treated and then released, Crump said.  The victims were shot outside of the house, and police say they believe the suspects left in a vehicle.  Crump said multiple vehicles were leaving at the time, and it also appears shots may have been fired from someone on foot.  Investigators have not yet released any suspect or suspect vehicle descriptions.  Anyone who was at the party or has information about possible suspects is urged to call Phoenix police or Silent Witness at 1-800-WITNESS to remain anonymous.
