A Suffolk County teen was killed and three others injured early Christmas morning when three masked men burst into an auto repair shop in Medford and demanded money from the victims before opening fire, Suffolk cops said.  A group of friends were socializing at Ray’s Engine Installation on Cedarhurst Avenue at 3:30 a.m. Wednesday morning when at least two men entered through a door and began barking demands for money, according to Suffolk County homicide chief Jack Fitzpatrick.  The assailants opened fire on the group of three men and a female and fatally struck Taliek Bristel, 19, who was found dead at the scene.  The female was hit in the abdomen and the other two male victims were both shot in the back, officials said.  They were rushed to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital Medical Center in East Patchogue with non-life-threatening wounds, cops said.  There have been no arrests in the case yet and the investigation is continuing.  Suffolk cops would not comment if the robbers made off with any money or valuables.
