Police are searching for 29-year-old Joseph Brown, who they identified as a suspect. Authorities said it was unclear what prompted the shootings.  The shooting victims weren't identified by police.  According to police, Brown knocked on the door of an apartment in the Gravesend Houses and was let in by a 62-year-old woman. Brown went into a back bedroom, shut the door and then fired shots, police said. A 24-year-old man was shot in the head.  Brown then came out of the room and shot the woman who had answered the door in the stomach.  A third man was shot in the head and killed. The fourth victim, a 40-year-old male, was grazed in the head by a gunshot and treated at the scene.  Police say there were three other people in the apartment who were not shot, including a 10-year-old boy.  The woman and the 24-year-old man were in critical condition at Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn, police said.  Copyright 2013 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
