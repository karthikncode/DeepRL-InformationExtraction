All four men were taken to area hospitals where their conditions stabilized, Greer said. An 18-year-old was shot in the buttocks and taken to John H. Stroger Hospital. A 38-year-old was shot in the right thigh and was taken to Stroger Hospital.  A 26-year-old was also taken to Stroger Hospital where he was treated for a graze wound in the head. Another 26-year-old was shot in the buttocks and was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital, police said.  Police said the shooting appeared gang-related, but no one was in custody as of Tuesday morning. After the shooting, the gunman got into a dark-colored sedan and drove eastbound on West 24th Street.  The four men were among nine people who were wounded in shootings across the city's South and West sides since Monday evening.
