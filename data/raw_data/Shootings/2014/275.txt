THAT VIGIL WAS HELD ON PATENT STREET NEAR SCHOOLCRAFT AT SOME POINT TEMPERS GOT HEATED AND SHOTS WERE FIRED. THAT SCENE THEN SPILLED OVER LEADING TO A CRASH AT THE CORNER OF BURT ROAD AND WEST CHICAGO LET'S GET TO LAUREN PODELL. LAUREN, A COMPLICATED CHAIN OF EVENTS. WALK US THROUGH WHAT HAPPENED? Reporter: WELL,, ASHLEE, HERE'S WHAT WE KNOW. DETROIT POLICE CHIEF JAMES CRAIG JUST KIND OF WALKED THE MEDIA THROUGH EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND AS YOU MENTIONED IT IS COMPLICATED. WE DO KNOW THAT SOMEONE OPENED FIRE WHO WAS ATTENDING THE VIGIL AT THAT HOUSE AND THAT'S WHEN SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO WERE ALSO ATTENDING THE INDIVIDUAL OIL PATENT STREET RETURNED FIRE. YOU HAVE MULTIPLE PEOPLE SHOOTING MULTIPLE WEAPONS RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE CONFIRMED THAT FOUR PEOPLE WERE INJURED FROM GUNSHOT WOUNDS AT THAT HOME ON PATENT STREET. ONE WAS SHOT AND KILLED. THAT THEN LED TO A POLICE CHASE, A SMALL ONE A VEHICLE CRASHED ANOTHER PERSON DIED. RIGHT NOW POLICE ARE MAKING PROGRESS BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO STARTED THIS AND WHY. A VIOLENT NIGHT ON DETROIT'S NORTHWEST SIDE HAD POLICE INVESTIGATING TWO SCENES AFTER MULTIPLE PEOPLE WERE SHOT AT A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL. DETROIT POLICE ARE REMEMBER CANNING TWO PEOPLE ARE DEAD, INCLUDING 33-YEAR-OLD REED. IN A TOTAL OF FIVE OTHERS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOT AND ARE IN SERIOUS CONDITION.

DETROIT POLICE SAY THREE WEAPONS WERE RECOVERED INCLUDING A PISTOL IN THE CAR AND AN ASSAULT RIFLE AT THE HOME. NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT SPARKED A SHOOTING AT A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE IN MOURNING. NOW WE'RE FACING TWO OTHER VIGILS BECAUSE THEY HAVE YOUNG LADY HERE WHO IS DEAD. ANOTHER PERSON THAT IT'S SENSELESS AND IT'S STUPID. THERE'S NO REASON FOR IT. Reporter: YEAH, THIS ONE REALLY HAS POLICE SCRATCHING THEIR HEAD. THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT THREE PEOPLE ARE IN CUSTODY. THEY ARE RIGHT NOW BEING QUESTIONED BY D.P.D. OFFICERS TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS. SOMETHING ELSE WE SHOULD MENTION, A LOT OF THIS CHAOS SPILLED OVER ONTO THE HOSPITAL SCENES. A LOT OF THESE SHOOTING VICTIMS WERE TAKEN TO SINAI GRACE OR DETROIT RECEIVING WE HAVE LEARNED FROM DETROIT POLICE THAT A LOT OF THE FAMILY AND FRIENDS OF THOSE SHOOTING VICTIMS WERE ARRIVING TO THE HOSPITAL GETTING IN FIGHTS AND ALTERCATIONS. SEVERAL OF THEM WERE ARRESTED THIS MORNING. NOW SOME OF THESE FAMILY AND FRIENDS JUST STARTING TO LEARN WHO'S INJURED, WHAT CONDITION THEY'RE IN. ASHLEE A VERY DRAMATIC SCENE THIS INVESTIGATION IS STILL UNFOLDING AND DETROIT POLICE ARE SAYING THEY'RE STILL LOOKING FOR MORE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO COULD BE ARMED AND DANGEROUS. BACK TO YOU. NOW LAUREN, THE INDIVIDUAL WRIT SHOOTING STARTED WAS THAT BEING HELD FOR SOMEONE WHO ALSO DIED IN A VIOLENT CRIME? WELL, FOR QUITE SOMETIME WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THIS VIGIL WAS FOR. WE HAVE FINALLY LEARNED FROM DETROIT POLICE THAT THE PEOPLE AT THE HOME ON PATENT WERE HAVING A VIGIL FOR A YOUNG MAN WHO DIED IN A CAR ACCIDENT EARLIER THIS WEEK. SO NO, THE VIGIL WAS NOT FOR SOMEONE WHO DIED IN A SHOOTING OR ANY GUN VIOLENCE.
