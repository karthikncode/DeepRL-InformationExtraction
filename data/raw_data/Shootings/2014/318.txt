Five people were shot and wounded when a gunman opened fire in a Pomona park Saturday night, police said.  Officers were called to Palomares Park at 499 E. Arrow Highway at about 7:55 p.m. after reports of shots fired from a nearby vehicle, police said.  Three men and two women who "frequent the park" suffered gunshot wounds and went to Pomona Valley Medical Center, said Lt. Ron McDonald. They were reported in stable condition.  The gunman remains at large.  Investigators are trying to determine if the attack was gang-related. The victims range in age from 31 to 56, McDonald said.  Twitter: @CarlaRiveraLat
