Police say one person was killed and three others injured in a shooting in unincorporated North Richmond on Saturday night.  At around 10 p.m., deputies responded to reports of several people who had been shot in front of a home in the 1600 block of First Street, Contra Costa County Sheriff's spokesman Jimmy Lee said.  Two victims were taken by private vehicle to Doctors Medical Center in San Pablo before deputies arrived at the scene, Lee said.  Two other victims remained at the scene and were taken by ambulance to John Muir Medical Center, he said.  One of the victims who had been taken to Doctors Medical Center -- a 23-year-old man -- was flown by helicopter to John Muir, where he later died, Lee said.  The victim's name was not released.  The three other victims were expected to survive, Lee said.  No suspects have been identified.  Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Office at (925) 313-2600 or the anonymous tip line at (866) 846-3592.
