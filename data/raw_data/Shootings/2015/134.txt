Police in Lexington are investigating a shooting at Douglass Park.  Police say around 9:15 p.m. on Sunday, a basketball game turned violent when shots were fired.  Police say three people at the scene were taken to the hospital with injuries.  Police tell WKYT that two other people showed up at the hospital with gunshot wounds, shortly after the shooting. Police believe they are connected to the incident at Douglass Park.  Officers say that one of the victims is in critical condition. The other four people have non-life threatening injuries.  Right now, police do not have any description of the shooter and are asking for anyone with information to come forward.  "When the shots were fired, there was a lot of chaos, so we're having difficulty identifying witnesses. So we're making a big plea for people if they were here and they saw anything or they know anything. They don't have to meet us in person, they can call 859-258-3700 or they can reach us through Blue Grass Crime Stoppers," Lt. Jonathan Bastian told WKYT.  Police say they have recovered evidence in Douglass Park and the forensic investigators are searching the park.  Since there are conflicting witness statements, police say they don't know how many shooters they are looking for.
