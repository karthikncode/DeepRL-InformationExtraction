Seven people were shot — all of them in the leg — in a single incident overnight on Baltimore's west side, police said early Sunday.  Police responded to an area hospital at 2:26 a.m. Sunday, where five people walked in with gunshot wounds. Shortly thereafter, officers encountered two additional victims from the same incident — which police said transpired in the 2700 block of Garrison Avenue in the Central Park Heights neighborhood.  All seven victims suffered gunshot wounds to their legs, and were listed in stable condition, police said.  The victims included 20- and 23-year-old women, and men ranging in ages from 22 to 25.  Northwest District detectives are investigating and anyone with information may call 410-396-2466.  The shootings transpired amid a violent two-hour span in Baltimore in which 10 people were shot and one man was killed.  The homicide was the second of the first weekend in August after 45 people were killed in July — equaling the most in a given month in at least four decades.  sjwelsh@baltsun.com  Twitter.com/seanjwelsh  Editor's note: This story has been updated from an earlier version, which — based upon information from Baltimore police — misstated the block in which the shooting occurred.
