One person is dead and four others are injured Friday after a shooting in northwest Baltimore.  Police reported a multiple shooting around 3 p.m. at the Hilltop Shopping Center in the 5500 block of Reisterstown Road.  Baltimore police said James Gaylord, 71, died, and three other men, ages 54, 33 and 26, and a woman, 41, were injured. Police said the victims were all in stable condition.  Police said a patrol officer in the area spotted a person lying on the ground and then found the other victims nearby.  "It's 3 o'clock in the afternoon. Kids are getting out of school, people are getting off of work, we have the MVA in the shopping center along with many other businesses, so whoever did it is a reckless individual who is capable of doing something like this again, and we need to get that person identified and off the streets as soon as possible," Baltimore police Director T.J. Smith said.  A witness, Willie Johnson, described what he saw: "Just firing, firing of the guns and stuff, and then after that, everybody started running."  Police don't yet know what happened before the shots were fired.  "We don't know if those people were targets of this. In all likelihood, some of them were innocent victims who were in the shopping center," Smith said.  "It's sad. Life doesn't mean anything anymore, and it's like, here today, gone tomorrow. They don't think about their family. They don't think about the family of the people they're hurting. It just makes me terrified for my children," said Ryekiesha Paul, who was at the shopping center.  Police are asking that anyone with information about this shooting to call Metro Crime Stoppers at 866-7LOCKUP.  Refresh wbaltv.com and our app, and watch 11 News for late-breaking updates.
