Five people were injured in a shooting at an apartment complex in south Fort Worth on Tuesday night.  Police say it was the result of family violence when the father of one woman's child opened fire with a shotgun on a group of adults.  Police say none of the injuries are life-threatening.  Roy Stewart, the uncle of an apartment complex resident, heard the gunshots and went to check on his niece.  “She just told me that she was with a girl that got shot and she got hit in her leg with a pellet or something like that,” said Stewart. “So I was just concerned and coming over here to check on her because the girl has already gone to the hospital.”  Fort Worth police have not commented on whether the shooter was arrested.
