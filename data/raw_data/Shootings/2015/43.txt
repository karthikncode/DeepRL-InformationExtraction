Investigators are trying to figure out who is responsible for gunfire that erupted in a northwest Atlanta neighborhood Saturday, sending five men to the hospital.  Police are hoping to get more information from the victims.  Detectives went to Grady Memorial Hospital Sunday to interview three of the five shooting victims being treated there.  Family members told Channel 2 Action News that two of the victims were treated and released.  Atlanta police said they are trying to sort out if any of the victims are also suspects, and who was shooting at the Delmar Villas in the Adamsville neighborhood.  Police taped off three different crime scenes after the shootings.  Two victims ran to neighboring complexes before collapsing, according to police.  Neighbors said it sounded like a shootout in the common area of the apartments, and that they heard up to 50 gunshots.  "I don't have any idea. All I heard was just pop, pop, pop, pop like that," resident Sudie Dorsey said. "It's an everyday thing."  Atlanta police's gang unit also helped in the investigation.  The two other victims were taken to Atlanta Medical Center, police said.
