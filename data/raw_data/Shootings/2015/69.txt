"Terrible, terrible,” neighbor Lorene Stinson said of the shooting.    He drove by as about a dozen officers combed through the crime scene on Bost Street.  IMAGES: West Charlotte shooting    James Stover lives across the street, and said he was asleep just before 6 a.m. when he heard commotion and about 10 gunshots.
