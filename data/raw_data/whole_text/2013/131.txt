AKRON, Ohio - Four people were found shot in the head in an Akron townhouse Thursday afternoon, police said.  A friend found the bodies shortly before 3 p.m. in the basement of a house on Kimlyn Circle. The townhome is off of Independence Avenue and less than a mile from Chapel Hill Mall.  The Summit County Medical Examiner's Office conducted autopsies Friday that showed all four died from a single gunshot to the head. The medical examiner's office identified the victims as Ronald Roberts, 24; Kem Delaney, 23; Maria Nash, 19, and Kiana Welch, 19.  Family members said Roberts, who lived in the townhouse, and Welch were dating.  "My thoughts are that my son wouldn't have hurt anyone. He would have given you the shirt off his back, and whoever did this needs to be found and held responsible," Roberts' mother said. "Now, I have a 24-year-old son to put away, for what? Can you please tell me why?"  "My brother was a good kid," said one man at the scene. "My brother was a good kid; he ain't deserve to get killed like that. Whoever did it, I hope you turn yourself in or get found."  Officers spent the evening canvassing the area for shell cases and talking to neighbors.
