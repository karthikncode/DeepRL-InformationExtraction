KOTV (CBS/AP) TULSA, Okla. - A preliminary hearing is scheduled for two brothers charged in the January shooting deaths of four women at a crime-plagued Tulsa apartment complex.  PICTURES: Okla. twins killed in apartment shooting  Preliminary hearings for Cedric and James Poore are scheduled in Tulsa County District Court Tuesday morning.  The two are charged in the killings of 23-year-old twins Rebeika Powell and Kayetie Melchor, 33-year-old Misty Nunley and 55-year-old Julie Jackson. They've pleaded not guilty.  Court records show both men have prior felony convictions for robbery. Prosecutors have yet to decide whether they will seek the death penalty.  Police say the Poores were staying in the same apartment complex as the four victims, who were found bound and shot in the head.  Authorities believe the brothers robbed the women, then killed them because they feared they would be identified.  Complete coverage of the Tulsa apartment murders on Crimesider
