Three people were found dead Friday morning from a shooting in Harbor Gateway.  Los Angeles police received a 911 call about 5:35 a.m. from a resident reporting hearing eight or nine gunshots in an apartment building in the 1600 block of West 205th Street. Police found three victims.  A fourth victim was discovered more than a block away, near Del Amo Boulevard and Western Avenue, covered in blood, said LAPD Officer Christopher No. That person, whose condition was unavailable, was taken to a hospital.  Authorities said a red Dodge Charger and a gray Ford Explorer were seen speeding away from the scene.  Friday's deaths were the first homicides in the Harbor Gateway this year, according to a Times' Homicide Report.
