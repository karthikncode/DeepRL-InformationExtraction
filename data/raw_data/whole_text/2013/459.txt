WASHINGTON (CBSDC/AP) — A man who died following a shooting in the NOMA neighborhood of D.C. late Wednesday has been identified.  WNEW’s John Domen reports that the shooting, which also injured three others, all started when an outdoor dice game near the intersection of First and Pierce Streets NW was broken up by masked suspects just before midnight.  Many shots were fired — one neighbor says she lost count of how many.  Officers found four men suffering from gunshot wounds. One of them, identified as 32-year-old Delonta Hendrix, died of his injuries at a hospital. Police say the other three suffered non-life threatening injuries.  The suspects fled and have not been located, authorities say. The investigation is ongoing.  The shooting occurred near the location of a drive-by shooting that injured more than a dozen others in March.  WNEW’s John Domen contributed to this report. Follow him and WNEW on Twitter.
