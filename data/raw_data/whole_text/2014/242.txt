The men were in a lounge in the 8300 block of South Halsted Street around 2:35 a.m. when someone drove past in a light colored car and opened fire. A 30-year-old was shot in his chest and transported to Advocate Christ Medical Center in critical condition. He was later pronounced dead, said Officer Ana Pacheco, a Chicago police spokeswoman.  The man was identified as James McCoy, of Peoria, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office.  A 39-year-old man was also taken to Christ Hospital in stable condition after being shot in his buttocks. A 32-year-old man was shot in his chest and taken to Stroger in serious condition. A 41-year-old was shot in the ankle and in good condition at Little Company of Mary Hospital, Pacheco said.  Police had been called to the club before the shooting — at 1 a.m. and 2:10 a.m. — for noise, the Tribune reported. There were 200 to 300 people reportedly inside and outside the club when police responded the first two times, the Tribune said.  No one is in custody for the shooting.
