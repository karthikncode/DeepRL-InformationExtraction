Three people were hurt and a teenager died in a Stockton shooting Monday evening, police said.  Gunfire rang out about 7 p.m. at a home in the 1500 block of East Ninth Street, near Airport Way, the Stockton Police Department said.  The three surviving victims, all hospitalized, have been identified as a 20-year-old man, an 18-year-old man and a 13-year-old boy, police said.  The 18-year-old was listed in critical condition as of just before 10 p.m.    The other two are expected to survive, officers said.  It was one of the victim's homes where the shooting took place, officers said. The victims were found in the garage when police arrived, officers said.  When police got to the house, just before 7:05 p.m., the 17-year-old -- now identified as Jose Novoa, per the coroner -- had already died at the scene.  Detectives are now conducting a homicide investigation. They're not clear on a motive.    There's no word on who is responsible, and a suspect description hasn't been released, either.  This is considered a high-crime area of Stockton, a police spokesman said.  A family member of two of the victims told KCRA 3 that his brother and cousin were among the injured.  The relative who asked only to be identified as Miguel said the pair remained at the hospital as of late Monday night.  The man who was killed was a barber, Miguel said.  Miguel wasn't sure on the identity of the third person.  Police on scene wouldn't comment.  KCRA 3's Kathy Park contributed to this report.  Stay with KCRA and KCRA.com for the latest information.
