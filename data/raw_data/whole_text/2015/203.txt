Three men walked into a Pine Hills gas station with gunshot wounds Saturday night as a fourth shooting victim was found about six miles away, officials said.  The shooting victims, all in their 20s, were taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center where their conditions remain unknown, according to Lourdes Clayton, spokeswoman for the Orange County Sheriff's Office.  The incident began unfolding around 8 p.m. when Orange County deputies responded to the ramp onto State Road 408 near Pine Hills Road in reference to a shooting, Clayton said.  At the same time, three shooting victims walked into the Circle K on West Colonial Drive near Powers Drive, according to Clayton.  The fourth shooting victim was found near Orange Center Boulevard and Goldwyn Avenue, Clayton said.  Deputies said it's unclear where the victims were actually shot, but shell casings were found on the 408 ramp.  Pine Hills Road was closed for several hours from Colonial Drive to the 408 as the investigation continued.  An Orange County sheriff's helicopter was spotted flying overhead late Saturday night as deputies investigated the three active crime scenes.  David Harris
