ROSEBURG, Ore. — A 26-year-old man opened fire on a community college campus here in a rampage that left 10 people dead and seven wounded and turned this rural stretch of southern Oregon into the latest American locale ravaged by a mass shooting.          Students described scenes of carnage concentrated in a public speaking class that was underway in a college humanities building, and people fleeing in panic from classrooms as they heard shots nearby.  The college, Umpqua Community College, went into lockdown, and the gunman died in an exchange of gunfire with police officers who responded, law enforcement officials said.  With anxious parents waiting at a fairground near the campus and the police going from classroom to classroom, the authorities’ reports of the death toll varied throughout the day. At a 5 p.m. news conference, John Hanlin, the sheriff of Douglas County, said that he believed there were 10 dead, calling the toll the “best, most accurate information we have at this time.” He declined to say whether the gunman was included in the death toll.  Photo  Law enforcement officials identified the gunman Thursday night as Chris Harper Mercer, and said he had three weapons, at least one of them a long gun and the other ones handguns. It was not clear whether he fired them all. The officials said the man lived in the Roseburg area.  They said one witness had told them that Mr. Mercer had asked about people’s religions before he began firing. “He appears to be an angry young man who was very filled with hate,” one law enforcement official said. Investigators are poring over what one official described as “hateful” writings by Mr. Mercer. The F.B.I. has dispatched dozens of agents to assist in the investigation.  Sheriff Hanlin said at a news conference that he would not speak the gunman’s name.  “Let me be very clear, I will not name the shooter,” he said. “I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.”  He also encouraged reporters “not to glorify and create sensationalism for him. He in no way deserves it.”  Photo  The massacre added the community college to a string of schools that have been left grieving after mass shootings, a list that runs from Columbine High School in 1999 to Virginia Tech in 2007 to Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., where 20 children were killed in 2012.  President Obama, in an impassioned appearance at the White House, said that grief was not enough, and he implored Americans, “whether they are Democrats or Republicans or independents,” to consider their representatives’ stance on gun control when they voted and to decide “whether this cause of continuing death for innocent people should be a relevant factor.”  State and local officials all expressed shock. Gov. Kate Brown said at a news conference that she felt “profound dismay and heartbreak.”  The first reports of shots came at 10:38 a.m. on what was the fourth day of the new session. Students said they took place in Classroom 15 in a building called Snyder that houses many English and writing classes.

There were about 20 people in the classroom. A middle-aged woman behind her rose to shut the classroom door and was struck in the stomach by several bullets.

Snyder Hall OREGON Roseburg Umpqua Community College Snyder Hall Teachers offices Classrooms Snyder Hall The shooting occurred in this section of the building.  “He was just out there, hanging outside the door,” Ms. Welding said of the gunman, “and she slumped over and I knew something wasn’t right. And they’re like, ‘She got shot, she got shot.’ And everyone is panicking.”  A friend of the injured woman dragged her into the room and began delivering CPR, Ms. Welding said. Someone clicked the door shut and the students huddled in the corner, blocking themselves with desks and backpacks. “I heard more shooting,” Ms. Welding said. “It was horrific. My whole body was shaking. A chill was going down my spine. We called 911.”  She added, “I was on the phone with my mom pretty much the entire time. I knew this could have been the last time I talked to her.”  Brady Winder, 23, who moved to Roseburg only three weeks ago, was in a writing class.  “We heard one shot,” Mr. Winder said. “It sounded like someone dropped something heavy on the floor, and everybody kind of startled. There’s a door connecting our classroom to that classroom, and my teacher was going to knock on the door, but she called out, ‘Is everybody O.K.?’ And then we heard a bunch more shots. We all froze for about half a second. Everybody’s head turned and looked at each other, trying to just grasp what was happening, and someone said, ‘Those are gunshots.’ We heard people screaming next door. And then everybody took off. People were hopping over desks, knocking things over.”  Continue reading the main story Video  Kortney Moore, 18, from Rogue River, told the Roseburg newspaper, The News-Review, that the gunman had asked people to stand up and state their religion and then started firing. She said she saw her teacher shot in the head, adding that she herself was on the floor with people who had been shot.  Federal law enforcement officials said they were examining an online conversation on 4chan, an anonymous message board, as well as other social media, trying to determine whether any of it was linked to the gunman. In that conversation, one writer said, “Don’t go to school tomorrow if you are in the Northwest.”  Roseburg, about 180 miles south of Portland, with a population of 22,000, is a part of the Pacific Northwest that in many ways has been left behind as the region has moved on toward an economy of technology and high wages. Once a major center for wood milling, it has struggled in recent decades as the timber harvests in the national forests that hug the community have declined.  Wine grape cultivation has helped some, but poverty and unemployment rates are high. In August, according to the most recent government figures, Douglas County had an unemployment rate of 8.1 percent, tied for the second-highest in the state. About 20 percent of residents in the city and county live below the federal poverty line.

The average student is 37, and popular courses of study include winemaking, nursing, welding and auto mechanics. “It’s a community college, so a lot of our friends and family attend this college,” Sheriff Hanlin said.

We thought we were a very safe campus, and having armed security officers on campus might change the culture.”  He added, though, that he did not believe a security guard could prevent a gunman determined to kill.  “If you want to come on the campus and you want to shoot five people, you are going to do that before our security would arrive,” he said.  Oregon is one of seven states with provisions, either from state legislation or court rulings, that allow the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The other states are Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Utah and Wisconsin.  Continue reading the main story Video  Numerous law enforcement agencies responded to Thursday’s shooting. Corey Ray, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, said the agency was sending teams, including canine teams, from Seattle, Portland and Eugene, Ore. They will join a team already on the ground that is helping search for firearms casings and other ammunition.  The apartment complex where the gunman had lived was roped off with police tape and under guard by deputies last night. Bronte Hart, 21, said she lived beneath Mr. Mercer, who she said would frequently shout at her for smoking on her balcony.  “He yelled at us, me and my husband,” said Ms. Hart, who lives in the complex with her husband and father. “He was not a friendly type of guy. He did not want anything to do with anyone.”  Ms. Hart and her father, Eli Loomas, said the authorities had shown up at the complex in the morning and begun asking questions about Mr. Mercer.  Eight miles south of the college, at a cordoned-off hall on the Douglas County Fairgrounds, family members spent agonizing hours waiting to hear of possible victims as students were evacuated there.  “The police searched everybody,” Mr. Winder, one of the students, said, “searching their jackets and bags for weapons before putting them on buses.”  Among those waiting were Jessica Chandler, whose daughter, 18-year-old Rebecka Carnes, started classes at Umpqua on Monday. Her daughter, an aspiring dental hygienist, had not responded to dozens of calls. A friend told Ms. Chandler that the teenager had been taken to a hospital, but the police and hospital officials would not confirm it.

Joanah Fallin was headed toward the campus around 10:30 a.m. when he saw a police car go by at what, he estimated, was 120 miles an hour. “I’ve never seen any car go that fast,” he said.  By the time he reached campus, it was already in mayhem. “Lot of people were crying,” he said. “There was a woman with a child. It was just unbelievable.”  Luke Rogers, another student, was in the building next door to the shooting. He said he and his classmates were locked in the building from 10:30 a.m. until noon, with the only access to information about the shooting coming from texts from friends and family.  “When we exited the building, the officers made us put our hands above our heads and leave in a single-file line,” he said. “As we passed Snyder hall, we saw the doors open, and on the ground there were drops of blood.”
