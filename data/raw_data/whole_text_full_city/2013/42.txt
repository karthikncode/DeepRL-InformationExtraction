CHICAGO (STMW) — Four people were wounded in a Thursday afternoon shooting on a South Shore neighborhood street — just a block away from where five people were wounded in a December shooting.  The four males were shot about 3:15 p.m. outside in the 2500 block of East 75th Street, police said. Their ages were not immediately available.  Paramedics took two victims to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County, one to Northwestern Memorial Hospital and one to South Shore Hospital, according to Fire Media Affairs. The conditions of the wounded ranged from good to critical.  The shooting happened just a block from the site of a Dec. 3 incident that left five people wounded at a bus stop at East 75th Street and South Exchange.  In that shooting, witnesses said two men approached a group standing on a corner and opened fire. Four of the victims were critically injured.  (Source: Sun-Times Media Wire © Chicago Sun-Times 2013.
