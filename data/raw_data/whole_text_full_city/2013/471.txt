Six people were shot Saturday in a single incident in Gary, Ind. Two male victims died.  The victims were all shot outside a home on the 9300-block of Sunrise Boulevard shortly after 4 a.m.  The other four victims -- two men and two women ? were wounded. Police said details were scarce later Saturday morning.  "We're still sorting it out. It may stem from a disturbance earlier in the night. We are looking for some individuals. We're interviewing witnesses," said Gary Police Dept. Chief Wade Ingram.  According to police, all six victims are in their 20s or 30s, and it appears to have been a drive-by shooting.
