A U.S. Marshals task force has arrested a man accused of crashing a New Years party and shooting four people after he was kicked out.

Police said Sims was one of four men who crashed the New Year’s gathering about 3 a.m. and then became angry when they were asked to leave.  McKeesport resident Gabriel Patterson said about 150 people were packed inside his home near the corner of Versailles and Coursin streets when the festivities came to a frightening and violent end.  “It was 3 o’clock in the morning. It was time for bed. They showed up. I told them it was time to leave. They didn’t leave; they got mad that I told them to leave and they start shooting,” Patterson said.  Authorities said Sims was one of those uninvited guests who fired the shots. He evaded authorities for 17 days.  Police said Sims shot three people in their legs or feet and another person in the abdomen. All were expected to recover.  Patterson said he was glad authorities were able to make the arrest.  Sims faces charges of criminal attempted homicide, four counts each of aggravated assault and recklessly endangering others, as well as firearms violations.
