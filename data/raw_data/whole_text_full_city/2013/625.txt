Fresno police are searching for a suspect who shot four people in Southwest Fresno.  The shooting happened on the corner of Oleander and Modoc around 7 p.m. Friday.  Investigators say a group of people were standing in front of their house when shots were fired. Three males were hit in the legs and neck and one female was shot in the back of the head.  One of the victims was only 15-years-old. Police say three of the victims are known gang members.  "The shooter snuck up and the victims were standing outside here at this house on the corner and several shots were fired and they were struck. They (the suspects) jumped back in the car and then fled the scene," Lt. Joe Gomez with the Fresno Police Department said.  All of the victims had non-life threatening injuries. Police say the suspected shooter drove away in a grey sedan with rims.
