SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) — San Francisco police said seven people were injured in a drive-by shooting, following a fight in the city’s Tenderloin neighborhood Sunday night.  Witnesses reported hearing arguing during what appeared to be a game of dice. A male suspect then shot the group near Turk and Taylor streets at about 8:55 p.m., San Francisco police Sgt. Danielle Newman said.  The suspect got into an argument with the victims and then walked to a double-parked silver sedan and pulled out a handgun from the car and began firing into the crowd lingering on Turk Street, Newman said.  Seven victims, all males, were transported to San Francisco General Hospital, treated and released for gunshot wounds and injuries to their extremities, Newman said.  The suspect then got into the passenger seat of the car and the driver headed westbound on Turk Street, Newman said.  Investigators have not been able to establish a motive or make any arrests. Police are checking to see if there’s surveillance video that captured the shooting.  No suspect information was immediately available.  © Copyright 2014 by CBS San Francisco and Bay City News Service. All rights reserved.
