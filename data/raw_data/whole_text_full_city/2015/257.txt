They say he started shooting again as the truck left the area.  All four victims were taken to Miami Valley Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.  Homicide detectives were called to the scene to launch their investigation. The initial investigation revealed the victims were at 1921 Oakridge Avenue when people in a black, older model pick up truck drove by and began shooting at them. Police say at least two people were in the truck.  “This does not appear to be a random act of violence,” Lt. Wendy Stivers said. “At this point, we believe the males were targeted.”  Anyone with information is asked to call 333-2677 or call Crimestoppers at 222-STOP (7867).
